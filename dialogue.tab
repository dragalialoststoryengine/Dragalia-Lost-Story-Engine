akasha_character_procedures_3f01b165	aka	This whole experimence has been more unpleasant than I anticipated. Allow this frown (frown1) to express my innermost feelings.	game/akasha_character_procedures.rpy	557	aka "[what]"
akasha_character_procedures_1aeeb443	aka	Are we done now? I'd very much like to get back to my exploration now...	game/akasha_character_procedures.rpy	560	aka "[what]"

alex_character_procedures_ee07a4ca	ale	Now that I'm a part of your inner circle, I'm privy to a host of sensitive information that could greatly endanger our comrades if it slipped.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	786	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_1a4970c4	ale	(askance grimace2) And I'm sure I don't have to remind you of the methods my former employers have used to gain information from others in the past...	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	789	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_7a39b77a	ale	That's why I need to gain as much control over my bodily and facial motions as possible. Even a small twitch at the wrong moment under torture could leak a sensitive piece of information to our enemies.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	792	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_e35683ee	ale	(frown3) ...You say you're going to make sure I'm never in that position?...	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	795	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_2c8a7b9d	ale	...I don't know if I'll ever be able to be that confident, but... when you say it, it somehow reassures me a bit...	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	798	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_c0f1b818	ale	In any case, I've made up my mind. In order to not be a liability to you, I want you to make sure I can maintain composure from all angles and control my facial expressions.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	801	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_0cef2095	ale	If you're ok doing so, I'd like you to check my physiological responses from a variety of angles while I change my expression.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	802	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_d8db2f67	ale	I'll start with a 'relaxed' expression and a mutter ('mutter1') that's a restrained as possible. If there's any discrepancies you notice, please let me know.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	805	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_51164d16	ale	And please also check the same expression ('relaxed, mutter1') from the back to make sure there aren't any wayward twitches in my neck or back muscles.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	809	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_fddf18a5	ale	Now I'll switch to an 'angry' expression and a frown ('frown1'). Again, let me know about any discrepancies.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	814	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_56479b3e	ale	And please also check the same expression ('angry, frown1') from the back to make sure there aren't any wayward twitches in my neck or back muscles.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	818	ale "[what]"

alex_character_procedures_ec70b815	ale	And please also check the same expression ('blush, frown2') from the back to make sure there aren't any wayward twitches in my neck or back muscles.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	827	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_eaa81303	ale	Now I'll try a 'focused' expression and a grimace ('grimace1'). Again, let me know about any discrepancies.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	832	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_3f28475c	ale	And please also check the same expression ('focused, grimace1') from the back to make sure there aren't any wayward twitches in my neck or back muscles.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	836	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_d71b1265	ale	Now I'll try a 'sad' expression and a pout ('pout1'). Again, let me know about any discrepancies.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	841	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_3a9b1440	ale	And please also check the same expression ('sad, pout1') from the back to make sure there aren't any wayward twitches in my neck or back muscles.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	845	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_aa347086	ale	It's also important to be able to maintain composure at high speaking volume so... I'm going to try a shocked ('shock') expression and a shout ('shout1')!!! Sorry about this, let me know if you see anything off!!	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	850	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_d060411b	ale	And also do the same thing from the back and check my expression ('shock, shout1')! Make sure there's nothing out of order!!	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	854	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_57d34275	ale	...I'm really sorry about subjecting you to that. I promise I'm almost done. Just check this squinting ('squint') expression with a smile ('smile1') and make sure it's all fairly composed.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	859	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_af5e8d28	ale	And... also do the same thing from the back, please, like usual ('squint, smile1').	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	863	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_da3a1bdb	ale	And last but not least, I want to be able to convincingly feign surprise if given information that I said I didn't know. Does this 'surprised' expression look real enough?	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	868	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_91891f77	ale	Even from the back ('surprised')? If nothing's off, that probably means I have the required level of facial control to pull it off.	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	872	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_bc7fd232	ale	...Well, I think that's a pretty exhaustive routine. If you think everything's in order, then that puts me at ease...	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	876	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_16eb7a97	ale	...even if it meant I had to put on a somewhat, erm, embarrassing display back there... Thank goodness Elisanne wasn't around...	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	879	ale "[what]"
alex_character_procedures_6a54fd94	ale	..."Were you making your face blush again intentionally just now?" ...Oh no, perhaps I still have a little ways to go on my facial control...	game/alex_character_procedures.rpy	882	ale "[what]"

combat_animation_test_4b6b24a6	bers	Look out! The enemy strikes like lightning!	game/animation_test_procedures.rpy	369	bers "[what]"
combat_animation_test_d016135e	bers	Heh. The enemy's movements are slowing.	game/animation_test_procedures.rpy	373	bers "[what]"
combat_animation_test_a71e8af4	bers	En garde!!!	game/animation_test_procedures.rpy	380	bers "[what]"

story_animation_test_6cd94c4f	bers	How embarassing. You would think I would know the castle better by this point.	game/animation_test_procedures.rpy	431	bers "[what]"
story_animation_test_de31a695	bers	This should be the way to go.	game/animation_test_procedures.rpy	435	bers "[what]"

berserker_character_procedures_40b28e3a	bers	Ah, greetings. I did not expect you to join me on my night patrol.	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	229	bers "[what]"
berserker_character_procedures_d35f4272	bers	(neutral) As it happens, I once performed several jobs for this village back when I was a freelance mercenary.	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	232	bers "[what]"
berserker_character_procedures_2917013f	bers	(closed_neutral) What kinds of jobs? I would rather not trouble you with those details.	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	235	bers "[what]"
berserker_character_procedures_c25d13e7	bers	(downcast) Back in those days, I didn't bother to question the morality of my jobs. As long as the commission provided a challenge, I relished it.	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	238	bers "[what]"
berserker_character_procedures_2620b21f	bers	(glint) There are, of course, days when I miss the freedom of that sort of lifestyle. Everyone was a potential opponent, and I did not have to temper my nature.	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	241	bers "[what]"
berserker_character_procedures_f04e26be	bers	(glint2) Fufufu... there was a particularly notorious bandit who had captured hostages. He was a strong, skilled fighter, and at the time, I intentionally drew out our fight, relishing the clash of steel on steel!	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	244	bers "[what]"
berserker_character_procedures_6cb52d61	bers	(askance) ...Ahem. My apologies, I became carried away for a moment.	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	247	bers "[what]"
berserker_character_procedures_ae12d2a9	bers	(surprised) In any case, since joining your cause, I've had to practice more restraint, but... I've found a unique form of gratification in wielding my sword to save lives rather than claiming them.	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	250	bers "[what]"
berserker_character_procedures_abe15a65	bers	It's rather fulfilling. I'm not sure if it exactly makes me feel 'alive' like I desire, but my sleep has come easier than in the past.	game/berserker_character_procedures.rpy	253	bers "[what]"

grace_character_procedures_02973c33	gra	...Let me start with a brief story. As you know, my husband and I were very happy together for a long time.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	413	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_1e01e75f	gra	Believe it or not, I was actually a really joyful person. My husband always used to say that my smile could brighten the entire room.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	416	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_f5c3e766	gra	However, things became very stressful for us when we first planned to defect from the Syndicate.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	419	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_c3fff97b	gra	I was really anxious all the time, and... something my husband said back then has been on my mind lately.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	420	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_15acb4b7	gra	He took me by the hand, and said, 'My dear, you look like you've forgotten how to smile. If we can't even save your own heart, we can't hope to save our patients. Please, be at ease, with me at least.'	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	421	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_c9b290c8	gra	I... was annoyed at the time, and after his death, those words felt like a bitter cruelty to me.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	422	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_c1a2d89d	gra	After all, how could I smile in a world without him?	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	423	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_5e9f69ae	gra	And yet... when I pray for my husband, I sometimes feel as though he is pained by the suffering on my face.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	424	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_c1315845	gra	I will never stop feeling sorrow and grief, but... I also do not wish to worry him.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	425	gra "[what]"
grace_character_procedures_30157176	gra	After all, if he feels I have still 'forgotten how to smile,' surely he will never be at peace.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	426	gra "[what]"

grace_character_procedures_2070f767	gra	Normally I would do this by myself, but I fear that I am no longer a good gauge of my own sincerity. I feel as though an outside opinion may, therefore, be in order.	game/grace_character_procedures.rpy	429	gra "[what]"

heinwald_character_procedures_fd8b281c	hein	I've been told lately that I'm a difficult person to read... emotionally speaking.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	494	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_bd992593	hein	I consider this somewhat of a feature, but I will admit that there are situations where being able to convey emotion would be logistically convenient.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	495	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_fc1208cc	hein	I want to make a number of facial expressions; would you mind giving me feedback?	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	496	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_c8edec63	hein	Very well. In that case I will begin with my usual 'focused' expression.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	499	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_d7c0cd84	hein	But I have other facial expression with equal focus (focused2).	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	502	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_e522741d	hein	And I can look focused in a different manner as well (focused3).	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	505	hein "[what]"

heinwald_character_procedures_eb7ff491	hein	Now, here's an important one: I want to convey that I'm annoyed. Is this an effective way to do so?	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	514	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_6f725043	hein	Now, this is more of a 'surprised' look, I suppose?	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	517	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_c4eb0a96	hein	And here is a slightly different surprised face (surprised2).	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	520	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_451bdbbb	hein	This is perhaps a face I would wear if I were relaxed.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	523	hein "[what]"

heinwald_character_procedures_5bd046c5	hein	This is a frown (frown1) that I usually wear, but there are others.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	538	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_429ad09f	hein	This is a different but similar frown (frown2).	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	541	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_2db2cf2d	hein	This is a slightly more noticeable frown (frown3). When I'm projecting more, perhaps.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	544	hein "[what]"

heinwald_character_procedures_01e94579	hein	If this is uncomfortable, maybe this smile (smile2) is better? I think it's a little more understated.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	556	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_348c5386	hein	Very well. In this case, here's a grimace to show my displeasure.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	559	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_00369323	hein	And a grin, to convey my confidence. I'm hoping this is somewhat intimidating, so I can deter my foes with my logic.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	562	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_0db4a275	hein	Perfect. I appreciate your feedback; I'll have to practice more at being expressive, I suppose. But this was already helpful.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	565	hein "[what]"
heinwald_character_procedures_6a12a7a8	hein	Well... I'm done with what I needed you for, and I want to get back to reading, so... you should leave now.	game/heinwald_character_procedures.rpy	567	hein "[what]"

ilia_character_procedures_c4ec24b0	ili	Hey, Mordecai! I've been thinking about the problem you brought up earlier.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	389	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_2de9fbd7	ili	When you told me that you had no idea what to do with your facial muscles since you just got them... yeah, that was a good point...	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	392	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_4b5067c0	ili	It was kind of a lot to expect you to get the whole concept of 'human expressions' when even the concept of EMOTIONS is foreign to you...	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	395	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_ca28ba72	ili	But... that's why I've decided to show you the ropes!	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	398	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_afbffe60	ili	See, humans have an entire portion of their brain that's entirely devoted to interpreting other people's emotions.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	400	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_73187fc2	ili	Since other people's emotions determine their actions a lot of the time, you could call it a survival instinct.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	401	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_8db45643	ili	But, see, you're from another world, so you haven't needed to know any of that before.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	402	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_26ee842d	ili	Anyway, my thought is that I can show you how a bunch of different emotions look on MY face and tell you what they mean!	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	405	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_ac51ee80	ili	That way, when you see somebody else making an expression, you'll have a point of reference to work off of.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	406	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_0df30300	ili	Make sense? Not really? Well, I think it's worth a shot, so... here goes!	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	407	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_4626e1b8	ili	Ok, so right now, i'm pretty relaxed and content. You can see my eyebrows are relaxed, and I also have a smile (smile1).	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	410	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_6886cc63	ili	But if something came up that was concerning or warranted my attention, my eyebrows might get more focused, and I'd have a small frown (frown1) like this.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	413	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_3973ce33	ili	Ok, now, let's say that I got injured or I had some internal pain. My eyes would flinch like this, and I'd frown with my teeth, which is called a grimace (grimace1).	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	416	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_4efeb6b0	ili	'Is pain an emotion?' Oh, huh. That's a good question. I suppose it depends...	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	419	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_bdfb5008	ili	Oh! Wait, this is a good opportunity!	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	422	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_f7768644	ili	Did you see how when you asked that question, I didn't know the answer right away? That's called being surprised, so my eyebrows went up and I frowned (frown2), but... in a different way?	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	425	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_0ff5deb5	ili	But there's a lot of other emotions, too. For instance, when someone's sad, the corners of their eyes might droop, and they might frown (frown3) more obviously.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	428	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_4b13a1e8	ili	They might try to hide it with a grin or something too (grin1), but it'll still be obvious from their eyes.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	431	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_18903c90	ili	...'Do *I* ever hide my sadness?' Uh... well, I dunno what to tell you... hahaha...	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	434	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_40244fd0	ili	...'Can smiles (smile2) be fake too?' Look, this wasn't exactly supposed to be an interrogation of my emotions...	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	435	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_66d603fa	ili	Oh. Wait. I want to show you something important.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	438	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_927914be	ili	...This expression? I guess you could call it 'serious.' With a frown (frown3), of course.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	439	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_f0b63977	ili	But Mordecai, I just thought of something you really should know.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	440	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_0468c7e2	ili	Now, even though Meene and I have been kind to you, it doesn't mean that all people will treat you the same day.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	441	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_33d484e6	ili	So you need to be able to tell when people are in an agitated or hostile frame of mind. Otherwise, you could wind up in danger.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	442	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_c95332ba	ili	When someone's angry, their eybrows come down like this. And they may raise their voice or grimace (grimace2).	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	445	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_ff28d8e7	ili	But even if it's just a small frown (frown4), some people can still have hostile intent, you can see it in their eyes.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	448	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_270f89cc	ili	If you run into someone who's looking at you like that, it could mean that they want to do harm to you.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	451	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_43d92e7a	ili	So if that happens, I want you to be careful. Get out of the situation if you can, or turn to somebody in the situation you can trust.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	452	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_cc1573a4	ili	'What if I'm the one who becomes angry?' You're worried about becoming angry yourself.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	455	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_ad7c3f04	ili	Well... I don't think that's very likely, since you're a really gentle person. But in a situation like that...	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	458	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_2d036911	ili	I guess you could... try to focus on WHY you're angry? If you get angry and act impulsively, you could do something you regret.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	461	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_04c1f1da	ili	But... if you get angry at me, or other people... well, I'd be sad, but I wouldn't be afraid of you. I really care about you, Mordecai.	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	462	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_a912f35d	ili	Well... that's enough of that depressing topic for now! Why don't we focus on studying up on some alchemy for now? I've got a really cool idea for a design...	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	465	ili "[what]"
ilia_character_procedures_7e628ac1	ili	'What does DEPRESSING look like now?' ...Oh boy, I think I unintentionally opened a huge can of worms here...	game/ilia_character_procedures.rpy	468	ili "[what]"

jupiter_character_procedures_5f13a134	jupi	(normal mouth_open1) This ought to be a guise more fitting of a royal meeting.	game/jupiter_character_procedures.rpy	345	jupi "[what]"
jupiter_character_procedures_7ff14d94	jupi	(surprised mouth_wide1) ...Yes, yes, obviously you're ALSO a royal. But... well, you don't act like it very much, do you?	game/jupiter_character_procedures.rpy	348	jupi "[what]"
jupiter_character_procedures_2861be99	jupi	(closed mouth_flap1) Chelle conducts herself like a ruler, her eyes full of ambition and yet inscrutable. Meanwhile... you're a bit of an open book who wouldn't hurt a fly.	game/jupiter_character_procedures.rpy	351	jupi "[what]"
jupiter_character_procedures_d4bfb6b9	jupi	...I'm not saying I'd rather be pactbound to her, I'm just saying you could take some pointers from her. She's interesting and fun.	game/jupiter_character_procedures.rpy	352	jupi "[what]"
jupiter_character_procedures_05cad508	jupi	Urgh... FINE! This is an even MORE formal form, just for you! Are you done being jealous, or can I go take my leave to find out what the princess wants of me?	game/jupiter_character_procedures.rpy	357	jupi "[what]"

luca_character_procedures_27578f5f	luc	...Well, Sarisse can basically read me like an open look at this point. It's super annoying...	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	569	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_42a6dc00	luc	My thought is that if I practice controlling my expression more, I'll be able to actually surprise her for once.	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	572	luc "[what]"

luca_character_procedures_776283d9	luc	And... this is a focused expression that's a little more intense (focused2)?	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	584	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_934ea861	luc	Now, this is more of a relaxed look. I really want to be able to pull this one off, so make sure it looks good!	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	587	luc "[what]"

luca_character_procedures_6a99be0b	luc	What? You can tell I'm faking?? That's... kind of surprising (surprised2) in its own right...	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	593	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_1c4c59bb	luc	I guess I still have a lot to work on before I can hide my emotions convincingly. Heh, look at me, I'm blushing!	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	596	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_408e0a31	luc	Uh... well, anyway, this next one is more of a flinch. Not really helpful unless I'm already caught, but... anyway...	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	599	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_825d0415	luc	And this is more of a frustrated look. Maybe this looks real?	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	602	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_cbd965a9	luc	And, if Sarisse keeps pressing me, I could look angry like this?	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	605	luc "[what]"

luca_character_procedures_e1a4aa4b	luc	And this is a really big grin (grin3)! This would be good for yelling 'SURPRISE'!!	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	629	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_db717a56	luc	Oh, but I should practice serious faces too. Here's a frown (frown1)...	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	632	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_32417918	luc	And this is a second frown (frown2) that has... a little more emotion in it? Maybe some annoyance?	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	635	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_d8ef1ad1	luc	This is more of an understated frown (frown3). Maybe a little neutral? What do you think?	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	638	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_971fe6d0	luc	This frown (frown4) has more teeth and is also wider and thinner. This would be good to express frustration.	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	641	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_e1b3ad7f	luc	Oops! This one (frown5)'s kind of goofy and awkward. ...What? You think it's cute? That's embarrassing!	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	644	luc "[what]"

luca_character_procedures_48a49811	luc	Geez, this is a lot harder than I expected... Definitely worth a grimace, huh?	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	656	luc "[what]"
luca_character_procedures_ae0fe08c	luc	For crying out loud, this is so much effort that I've got a bead of sweat!	game/luca_character_procedures.rpy	659	luc "[what]"

my_finni_friend2_18deb6c2	fin	I mean, I get that today doesn’t have the BEST personal significance for Eirene, but… was she THAT upset about getting some chocolate?!?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	518	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend2_52ed724b	fin	Or maybe… Eirene has been growing distant from me for a while?! Maybe she thinks I cause too many problems??	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	521	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend2_5d8cf356	fin	It’s true that I’m not as capable as her original Finni—THAT Finni disappeared a thousand-some years ago when Eirene implanted her damaged heart into me.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	528	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend2_fced00ff	fin	And… that happened on this exact date. The fourteenth of the second month of the year. The day I replaced her friend…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	529	fin "[what]"

my_finni_friend2_0a212b25	fin	I guess it’s true that Eirene and Elisanne go on a lot of missions together…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	544	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend2_fe6a83e0	fin	Maybe… Elisanne is a more trustworthy combat partner than me? Or… maybe she’s emotionally closer to me than her now??	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	546	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend2_1903a2eb	fin	AAAAAAGHHH!!! I’m freaking out just thinking about it!!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	548	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend2_dc9e67d7	fin	I… I just have to show Eirene that I can still be her best friend! That I'm her best friend in the world!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	550	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend2_052c4a15	fin	But… how do I do that?!? I don’t even know what's going on with her!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	552	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend2_c614eb54	fin	…I’m gonna need some help…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	554	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_5c2316e3	gra	...and that's why you thought to approach me on the matter? ...You do realize I am a widow and don't have an especially wide social circle, correct?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	572	gra "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_b4aa5909	fin	Exactly! You had the longest and most successful marriage of anyone I know here at the Halidom.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	576	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_259978ad	fin	(Well... actually, I wanted Laxi and Mascula instead, but... I couldn't find them anywhere. ...I don't think I should tell Grace she was my second pick, though...)	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	579	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_253f96da	fin	...A-Anyway, I know you and your husband started off as very close friends But... how did you guys maintain that for so long?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	582	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_a0ae3e48	fin	For instance... did you two ever... fight?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	585	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_ec93fd76	fin	I'm... well, I don't know exactly how to put it, but... I'm feeling a rift between me and Eirene, and I want to fix it...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	586	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_4cd189aa	gra	Hmm... well, we certainly had our share of disagreements. My husband did have a bit of a jealous streak, for instance...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	590	gra "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_c5ee2ee0	gra	He once saw me having lunch with a male researcher off in private, and he swooped in and practically dragged me away… It did bother me that his insecurities sometimes brought him to interfere with my social life…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	593	gra "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_bd63a495	gra	…Although I must admit, I was ALSO flattered that he thought I was so beautiful that I could make someone fall in love with me just by sharing a meal with them. What a high opinion he must have had of me!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	596	gra "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_7ebbdf01	fin	So… is that it? You just tried to remember that your husband was doing it out of attraction to you or something?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	600	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_a13dd6bc	gra	Well, it’s not as though that was all there was to it. After all, we shared a host of common ideals and goals. Medical research was very important to both of us, as well as the safety of our patients.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	606	gra "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_52f71484	gra	We cared about it so much, in fact, that we agreed to do something as risky as betraying the Syndicate to act on our mutual values.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	607	gra "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_a4738ec8	fin	Wow, that sounds like a really important factor…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	611	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_ecccd983	fin	Wait, of course! Eirene and I had been fighting for Ex Machina for thousands of years! Now that we’ve defected, we don’t have that old common goal anymore! That’s gotta be what happened!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	614	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_3c0a2524	gra	Um… I suppose so?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	618	gra "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_c772484b	fin	THAT’S IT!!! Eirene and Elisanne are both focused on their duties for the Halidom! That’s why they’ve been clicking together so well lately!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	622	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_917c0dd0	fin	…And, meanwhile, I’m kind of a spaz… Urgh… Guess that solves the mystery of why I got taken off patrol duty today…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	625	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_094c2227	fin	If I want to be close friends with Eirene again, I need to show her that I’m committed to our NEW common goal of protecting the peace of the kingdom!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	628	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_6e5d90bc	fin	Thank you SO much, Grace! You’ve made everything really clear for me!!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	631	fin "[what]"

my_finni_friend3_c58dba80	fin	WHEW! I got a little battered in the process, but that takes care of all the fiends in a two-mile radius of the Halidom. Now everyone should be able to have a peaceful Valentine’s Day!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	674	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_3747fc98	fin	And, more IMPORTANTLY, Eirene will see that I care about fulfilling my duties just as much as she does! She'll remember that she can trust me!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	677	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_65fbbe47	fin	Oh, perfect timing! Here she comes now!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	680	fin "[what]"

my_finni_friend3_4f5e46b7	eir	Yes, but I have never been this reckless about it! I can’t believe you would go off by yourself to fight fiends this large!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	712	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_cbe2362b	eir	And I especially didn't think you'd do so without telling anyone! You were specifically taken off patrol duty today, too, so if we hadn't followed the fiend corpses, we never would have found you!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	714	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_5f075446	elly	I am inclined to agree. If circumstances were slightly worse, you might have been in serious danger and without any reinforcements to protect you.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	718	elly "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_631601fe	fin	Look, I don’t need protection! I can handle myself, ok? I’m a reliable person!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	722	fin "[what]"

my_finni_friend3_db888d4a	eir	Can you just do that one thing for me? No more patrol duty, or anything else strenuous today.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	750	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_bfc8fd2a	fin	(Oh NO! I thought I would impress Eirene, but this had the exact opposite effect! Now she’s hurt, disappointed in me ...AND she’s gonna spend even MORE of today with Elisanne!!)	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	754	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend3_551a8b69	fin	Uh, I mean… Wouldn’t it be faster to have a second android helping? I mean, no offense, but I can move a lot faster than a flesh-and-blood human, and I’m stronger too!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	757	fin "[what]"

my_finni_friend5_fd37a3e7	fin	...No, I'm through with putting on a front to try to impress you. I’ve been feeling really awful and scared lately.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1473	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_31e90182	eir	...I thought that might be the case. Thanks for finally telling me.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1477	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_99ac0e5d	fin	Y-Yeah... Thanks to everything going on, I've been really scared. Feeling like I'm not good enough. Scared that you've... given up on me.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1481	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_668c92ab	fin	I… I saw you and Elisanne hanging out this afternoon. And how you gave her the candy I made you.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1484	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_2d114993	eir	I.. I see. That's... unfortunate. I hope you will understand once I give you the results.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1488	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_af2f5237	fin	Well, I don't know HOW I'm supposed to understand! I don't know what's going on with you anymore!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1492	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_8ca79939	fin	But... Elly seems to know. I can tell you two have been... really close lately. And... that actually hurt me a lot, if I'm being honest.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1495	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_7f74ed43	eir	Finni... I had no idea...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1499	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_7a152a07	fin	Augh, will you stop looking at me like that! I'm so sick of making you upset and worried all the time!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1503	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_a7b97633	fin	Argh, this isn't going at all how I wanted it to—I'm, I'm sorry, ok!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1506	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_bcbe5afe	fin	I'm sorry for being selfish, and defective, and useless! I just... I just feel so bad ALL THE TIME! I KNOW my heart is defective and bugged, and has a million instabilities!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1509	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_363dbe31	eir	Is... Is THAT what you think this is about? Finni, I'm so sorry, I thought we'd already talked through that, I don't think—!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1513	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_e3955e02	fin	Yeah, yeah, I KNOW, ok? "You're nothing like the original Finni, and that's ok! I don't think you're defective, it's ok that you have these freakouts!" I get it! You've already been more than accomodating with me.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1517	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_1d1b3bc2	fin	It's not like you're not being SUPPORTIVE enough! It's not YOUR fault I feel this way! But... when I see you all scared, and going out of your way to protet my feelings all the time... I just...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1520	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_825af598	fin	...I just... I just think that... if you'd never lost your original friend Finni, then you wouldn't even need to be having these kinds of conversations all the time! I wouldn't constantly be holding you back!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1523	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_bb933410	eir	Finni... Oh dear... please wait! That's not how I feel at all!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1527	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_cfd4c95c	fin	It's... It's ok, Eirene, you don't have to pretend that you're not hurting. I saw how you reacted when I said I wanted to celebrate today.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1531	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_84937221	fin	And... I understand now why you were so upset when I was damaged. Especially on the day you lost your first friend.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1532	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_cb764c12	fin	I mean... heck, you even took me off patrol duty to PREVENT that exact scenario, and I STILL screwed it up!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1533	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_d7fcddd8	fin	Let's face it, I'm kind of the resident QUEEN of bringing up painful memories for you.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1534	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_6f60a4b7	fin	It... It must be like living with a walking corpse.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1535	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_61a9b948	eir	Oh, F-Finni...!! Finni, I...!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1539	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_cbc8a09a	fin	And... I'm scared all the time too. Scared of losing you as a friend. Scared that you didn’t want to have to have me around as a reminder anymore.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1543	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_b20a32ce	fin	So I grabbed on tighter. I tried to impress you. I wanted to be better.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1544	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_465fd357	fin	But in doing so, I just drove you further away today and right into Elisanne’s best friend list…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1547	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_c23d2aa0	eir	...Uh...that's not really...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1552	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_7c5c251f	fin	No, I know, you aren't really that close. I know that.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1556	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_ce17be73	fin	But… it made me realize that there could be a future where I’m no longer the person who’s your best friend…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1559	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_2de4d577	fin	…And that terrified me.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1562	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_3c1eebf6	eir	Oh, Finni… I’m so sorry… this is all my fault… I've been acting so stupid…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1566	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_1fdbd159	fin	B-But, it’s ok, you know?! I got some good advice from some great people! And I realized… I’ve been being selfish this whole time.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1570	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_29081d11	fin	I thought I was looking out for you and trying to take care of YOUR needs… but I was really just feeding my OWN insecurities. I was trying to use you to prop MYSELF up.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1572	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_f15f7f9a	fin	But… I don’t want my friendship with you to be about ME! I want them to be about YOU! You’re the most important person in the world to me! I wanna be the kind of friend I can be proud of for you!!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1575	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_5d4ae549	fin	S-So, even if you don’t want me to be your 'best friend' anymore, I... I can accept that, you know! Because if that’s what you want, then I want that for you, too!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1578	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_5d5b44ee	fin	For the rest of my service life, all I want is to make you happy. As long as I can see you smiling sometimes—even just from a distance—that’s all I really care about.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1581	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_c47c07a6	fin	We… We promised to always fight together, until the day we both broke down… But...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1585	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_5f6960af	fin	…I’ve… I’ve decided to release you from that promise, Eirene! You don't have to keep associating with me anymore!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1588	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_77fe4c3a	fin	Because I don’t want ANYTHING to get in the way of your happiness! Not even me!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1589	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_f2bc3486	eir	!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1596	eir "[what]"

my_finni_friend5_d8a3a1e0	eir	Why can’t you see… Do you still think that all I see when I look at you is that original combat android?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1620	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_0d3231aa	eir	No matter how many times I tell you, you always feel like you're a disappointment to me! But...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1621	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_01d7cf73	eir	...Finni, you’re the only reason I have for going on!!! I gave up on my whole life in Ex Machina just to keep you safe!!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1622	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_27725b9c	eir	And... now you want me to leave you?!? Why can't I just make you understand how much I care about you, and want to be your friend forever??	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1623	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_d0d0eba4	fin	H-Hey, Eirene, I wasn't saying we HAVE to go no contact or anything!! I-I just wanted to let you know the OPTION was there!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1627	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_e5a1cd82	fin	I obviously wanna stay BFFs with you, I just, well, didn't want you to feel TRAPPED, is all! ...Geez...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1628	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_54247848	fin	...Let's, uh, just forget all about it, ok? It was just me being stupid like usual! Talking out of my chassis without thinking! "Stupid Finni," right? Ahaha...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1631	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_cd03035e	eir	…No, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you, Finni; this is all my fault! All day I was so focused on preparing things, but…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1636	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_ccd9689e	eir	…But… I left you all alone because I thought I was supposed to take care of things behind the scenes for you today.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1639	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_cd9b9451	eir	But... that just made you think I hated being around you!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1640	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_71538b89	eir	I'M the stupid one, Finni! I should have just celebrated that "Valentine's Day" friendship thing that you wanted us to instead of… making such a mess of everything!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1643	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_8e6f68b5	eir	You didn't need me to give you a break from patrol duties, or treat you any differently from normal…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1644	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_d33aa365	fin	E-Eirene? Oh man, I'm sorry I said anything... look at you, you're leaking coolant!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1648	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_e3db5cc1	eir	And… if I caused you to feel even slightly less valuable to me in order to make it... this data drive may as well just be a piece of trash!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1654	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_fb41b828	fin	N-No, if you took the time to make it, of course I wanna see this, uh...!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1658	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_d4646d65	fin	..."Data drive?" Now that you mention it, Alex and Laxi both said something about data you were collecting.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1659	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_8cb1522c	fin	Let's, see... (click) Uh, is this... an update to my parasympathetic simulation protocol software package?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1663	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_8441f9f9	fin	Uh... Thanks, I guess? I suppose this might help with the servo readjustments after my accident... I think...?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1666	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_3c4fe0f2	eir	It's not for that, it's supposed to... (sigh) Never mind, I think we should both just forget about it and go somewhere quiet together for a while.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1670	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_b309348b	eir	...You know, just the two of us spending time hanging out? ...Is that something friends do today?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1673	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_6ba45df6	fin	Hmm... I dunno, actually? All I heard about was the "giving out chocolate to friends" thing...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1677	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_3893af90	fin	...Haha... You know what? Who cares about what we're 'supposed' to do? I think I obsessed too much about it anyway.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1681	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_0c7511de	fin	Let's just wing it. That's how we wound up friends in the first place, right?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1682	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_725b6462	fin	So... let's start, well, "winging." ...Wanna go up the hill and watch the sun go down together?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1685	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_81e9b078	eir	...That sounds perfect.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1689	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_0496c204	elly	Eirene? Are you ready yet? Everyone's waiting.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1695	elly "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_1f39be9f_2	fin	...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1700	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_e313a592	eir	...Oh. Right. I should...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1704	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_1f39be9f_3	fin	...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1708	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_d1652c24	eir	...Actually, I'm sorry, Elly, I'm calling it off. Finni and I have somewhere more important to be right now.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1715	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_f934505d	eir	Isn't that right, Finni?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1716	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_e5a73557	fin	Hehe, yeah! That sunset isn't gonna watch itself!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1720	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_d199b259	elly	Wait... What? But what am I supposed to tell—?!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1724	elly "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_41687929	eir	Tell them thanks, but that I realized that all the plans were unnecessary. Nothing's more important than spending today with my best friend.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1728	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_71d9c559	eir	...Anyway, hurry up, Finni! We've got to move at maximum speed if we want to make it up the hill in time!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1732	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_3088ff76	fin	Hey, wait for me, hee hee hee!!! Don't tell me you're just trying to ditch me again!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1736	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_f7201fc7	elly	Wait, Eirene, hold up!!! Wait a second, you haven't explained—!?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1740	elly "[what]"
my_finni_friend5_ca6a3d7f	elly	...Augh, the cake's gonna be coming out any minute now! Geez!!! What am I supposed to do now!?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1743	elly "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_a76f4ed2	fin	Wow, we made it up the hill in time! And it's so beautiful!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1766	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_2fa06b0f	eir	Indeed. It's quite remarkable, even though it results from basic light diffusion phenomena.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1770	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_315ca628	eir	You know, back when we were employed by Ex Machina, downtime and detours were always minimized for us. It was seen as a waste of time.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1771	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_968f1d3e	eir	But being away from that environment, and observing how humans live their lives, has made me appreciate the value of these kinds of excusrions.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1772	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_ad713703	eir	Even if they don't have an obvious 'purpose,' they still feel... meaningful.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1773	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_2bef609e	fin	Yeah. Especially if you do these things with someone else.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1777	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_fac64f90	fin	There's a lot to be said for shared experiences, I guess. They tie people together.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1778	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_1f39be9f	fin	...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1783	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_62159715	fin	Hey, I wanted to apologize again for acting so awkward all day. I think the only reason I was pushing this holiday so hard is because I wanted to have a new experience with you.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1788	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_831933cf	fin	But... uh... maybe next time we should just get hyped about a DIFFERENT holiday?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1791	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_9ff9de0b	fin	This day's got some pretty negative undertones for you, and I should have factored that in more. My bad.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1792	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_3dc8526a	eir	Well... regarding that, I think I may have been giving off the wrong impression.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1796	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_f5da2c86	eir	This day's very significant for me, but ...in reality, I haven't associated it with negative connotations for many centures now.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1797	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_777c2750	fin	...Wait, WHAT?! No way!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1801	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_604a258c	eir	Y-Yeah. That's what I meant when I got upset and said, "You're not thinking about how I feel." ...And I'm sorry again for saying that, by the way.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1805	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_6a1cd409	eir	See, you get flustered whenever the concept of the original Finni gets involved, but...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1806	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_94a9b848	eir	...as I try to keep reminding you, I'm thankful for you the way you are.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1807	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_a98dd391	eir	And, additionally, the original Finni's damage was the main catalyst for your creation.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1808	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_3411a4d8	eir	So, without disrespect for the original Finni, I feel partly... thankful for that day.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1809	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_4c9931a7	eir	But I know that it's something you've deeply internalized, of course. Those feelings of inadequacy won't go away overnight.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1812	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_c22e067d	fin	Yeah... I'm sorry for being such a mess...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1816	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_feb2a647	eir	No, no, that's what I want to emphasize! I don't MIND it when you need reminders that I value you!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1820	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_dab2120f	eir	You're extremely important to me, and assisting you adds VALUE to my life!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1821	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_54ca12c5	eir	Does that make sense? Even in your percieved 'worst' moments, your friendship is still an enormous net positive to my happiness.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1824	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_70806814	eir	So please, don't read negativity into my feelings that isn't there!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1825	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_8f002c09	fin	Wow... I guess it makes sense when you put it that way, but... I don't think you've ever said that to me before.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1829	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_59c8e607	eir	Yes, well... I'm sorry I haven't been able to convey that until now. Interacting with humans has made me realize that I'm... not the best at conveying emotional content.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1833	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_461043f5	eir	And that's why, today, I was hyper-focused on—	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1834	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_a7a64f78	lax	>>Laxi, Elly TOLD us not to interrupt them—! Stop—!<<	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1839	lax "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_47b83101	fin	Wait, is that Laxi coming up the hill...?!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1842	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_2403f691	lax	Overruled. Organizing and then cancelling this event was illogical, as well as a misuse of our time.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1849	lax "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_96dfe3f0	lax	I demand the opportunity to present the results of my preparation.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1850	lax "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_d51fd103	lax	>>Ngh...! I'm not gonna let you get away with this!<<\n\nI hardly think... the manner in which I give it to her... is pertinent to you! Applying override to Mascula's control!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1853	lax "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_f3602e80	lax	>>H-Hey!!! That's it! The second my remote body gets here, I'm putting a stop to this!<<\n\nTry it then, if you think you have the capacity to do so.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1856	lax "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_95bd2814	fin	Tch... and just when we finally had a minute alone... (sigh)	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1860	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_d75e7f81	eir	Ah, my apologies. Once again, I think I may be responsible for this...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1864	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_28d7db25	lax	Greetings, Finni. Eirene has issued a contradictory set of instructions. I have, therefore, defaulted to an individual intervention.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1868	lax "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_8a30b48b	lax	I insist that you accept this token of my goodwill.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1869	lax "[what]"

my_finni_friend6_f03aa26b	lax	I thank you for acknowledging my wrapping talents. However, the contents are far more valuable than their container. I will remain here while you open it.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1881	lax "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_1c450e33	fin	Huh... Uh, well, ok, I guess...?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1885	fin "[what]"

my_finni_friend6_d7d800b6	lax	Precisely. This facial joint oil was specially formulated by Zardin to enhance both the lubrication and natural beauty of the android form.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1892	lax "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_84972a3e	lax	I have been making use of it for several weeks, and wanted to share my secret.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1893	lax "[what]"

my_finni_friend6_1fe9f0f9	masc	It's... well, it's not much, but it should last a while. And I laser-engraved your name on it!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1932	masc "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_fde04489	masc	...Oh! And Chelle had somewhere else she needed to be, but... she said I should give this to you, too.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1935	masc "[what]"

my_finni_friend6_15dabb42	fin	...Wait, hold up! Why is everybody suddenly giving me stuff??	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1943	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_291cabb7	masc	Wait, Eirene, you still haven't told her? I assumed that you cancelled because she didn't like it for some reason.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1947	masc "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_a40df72b	masc	...Urgh, Laxi!! Look what you've done now! Earlier you almost ruined Eirene's present, and now THIS!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1950	masc "[what]"

my_finni_friend6_487339fe	kar	You see, when the party was cancelled, I was quite distraught.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1977	kar "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_0628f511	kar	Not being able to reward a member of the Elite Justice Search on her special day would be a miscarriage of JUSTICE!!!	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1978	kar "[what]"

my_finni_friend6_d4496abe	eir	...but it looks like my earlier actions are catching up with me... I'm so embarrassed...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	1994	eir "[what]"

my_finni_friend6_840a02f0	eir	Finni, I'm sorry I didn't realize how important your plans for today were to you. I was shortsighted, and I clearly caused you a lot of worry...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2048	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend6_1cf17cc7	eir	...But... well, it was all because, in my mind, there was something even more important to celebrate today.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2051	eir "[what]"

my_finni_friend6_fced00ff	fin	And… that happened on this exact date. The fourteenth of the second month of the year. The day I replaced her friend…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2058	fin "[what]"

my_finni_friend7_cab4248c	fin	Well, that's unfortunate. At this rate, it sounds like Euden'll be tied up for… approximately the rest of the evening, if I had to guess?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2335	fin "[what]"
my_finni_friend7_91b2708e	fin	Total bummer... I suppose Elly’s gonna have to figure out some OTHER way to spend the rest of today, then…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2336	fin "[what]"

my_finni_friend7_c05ebc86	eir	Oh dear... Elisanne, you look agitated and unwell. This must be a shock, especially after you did so much to help with Finni's birthday.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2349	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend7_05f68a32	eir	Perhaps you should go sit down somewhere and rest. You've certainly earned a break...	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2350	eir "[what]"
my_finni_friend7_91a93213	elly	Yes, I… That sounds like a splendid idea…	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2354	elly "[what]"

my_finni_friend7_140565f6	ranz	...Yeah, yer probably right. Plus, negotiatin' with the fairer sex is just one o' the rungs on the ladder to manhood.	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2389	ranz "[what]"

my_finni_friend7_7b0ae62f	eir	...And even if so, those events happened in the middle of summer, so we have multiple months. Surely we can wait to figure the details out?	game/my_finni_friend.rpy	2504	eir "[what]"

my_finni_valentine2_338d8619	fin	E-Eirene, what—I mean, I knew that today had a lot of significance for you, but I just figured… maybe it’s better to just give the past a rest and do something different, you know?	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	576	fin "[what]"

my_finni_valentine3_b4aa5909	fin	Exactly! You had the longest and most successful marriage of anyone I know here at the Halidom.	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	747	fin "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_259978ad	fin	(Well... actually, I wanted Laxi and Mascula instead, but... I couldn't find them anywhere. ...I don't think I should tell Grace she was my second pick, though...)	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	752	fin "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_c2d99d13	fin	...A-Anyway, I'm here to ask you about what kept you and your husband together for so long.	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	757	fin "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_a0ae3e48	fin	For instance... did you two ever... fight?	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	760	fin "[what]"

my_finni_valentine3_4cd189aa	gra	Hmm... well, we certainly had our share of disagreements. My husband did have a bit of a jealous streak, for instance...	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	765	gra "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_c5ee2ee0	gra	He once saw me having lunch with a male researcher off in private, and he swooped in and practically dragged me away… It did bother me that his insecurities sometimes brought him to interfere with my social life…	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	768	gra "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_bd63a495	gra	…Although I must admit, I was ALSO flattered that he thought I was so beautiful that I could make someone fall in love with me just by sharing a meal with them. What a high opinion he must have had of me!	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	771	gra "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_7ebbdf01	fin	So… is that it? You just tried to remember that your husband was doing it out of attraction to you or something?	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	775	fin "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_a13dd6bc	gra	Well, it’s not as though that was all there was to it. After all, we shared a host of common ideals and goals. Medical research was very important to both of us, as well as the safety of our patients.	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	781	gra "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_52f71484	gra	We cared about it so much, in fact, that we agreed to do something as risky as betraying the Syndicate to act on our mutual values.	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	782	gra "[what]"

my_finni_valentine3_ecccd983	fin	Wait, of course! Eirene and I had been fighting for Ex Machina for thousands of years! Now that we’ve defected, we don’t have that old common goal anymore! That’s gotta be what happened!	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	791	fin "[what]"

my_finni_valentine3_c772484b	fin	THAT’S IT!!! Eirene and Elisanne are both focused on their duties for the Halidom! That’s why they’ve been clicking together so well lately!	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	805	fin "[what]"
my_finni_valentine3_917c0dd0	fin	…And, meanwhile, I’m kind of a spaz… Urgh… Guess that solves the mystery of why I got taken off patrol duty today…	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	811	fin "[what]"

my_finni_valentine3_3747fc98	fin	And, more IMPORTANTLY, Eirene will see that I care about fulfilling my duties just as much as she does! She'll remember that she can trust me!	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	872	fin "[what]"

my_finni_valentine3_ac60bcb8	eir	And I especially didn't think you'd do so without telling anyone! I made sure you didn't have patrol duty today, too, so if we hadn't followed the fiend corpses, we never would have found you!	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	922	eir "[what]"

my_finni_valentine4_c15f8ffd	fin	So... all I need to do is talk to Eirene and check in with her so she knows that I've just been feeling insecure, not glitched. One system check later, and all her worries will disappear!	game/my_finni_valentine.rpy	1339	fin "[what]"

tutorial_start_13ce1333	beud	Oh, I'm sorry, you don't have the power to speak right now. But... if you can be here right now, then maybe...	game/tutorial.rpy	59	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_1cbbd974	beud	...Right! You should be able to use the power of creation.	game/tutorial.rpy	65	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_e6acfd21	beud	In that case, we'll use that power to give you the power of choice. In other words, a "menu".	game/tutorial.rpy	69	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_e48e8618	beud	Repeat after me: "In the name of the first..."	game/tutorial.rpy	72	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_73314a0c	beud	No worries; I'm still processing it all myself, to be honest.	game/tutorial.rpy	82	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_460020a7	beud	Let's just focus on the matter at hand, then.	game/tutorial.rpy	83	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_1ca6db73	beud	Really? That's good to hear.	game/tutorial.rpy	92	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_f8d9449c	beud	If you're familiar with me, then you probably know that after I defeated Xenos, I had to be completely cut off from the remade world.	game/tutorial.rpy	95	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_30033fba	beud	After all, since I'm a part of Xenos, Xenos could use me as a link to the world if I remained connected to it.	game/tutorial.rpy	96	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_40e4c45b	beud	So I remade the world for my friends such that Xenos, and me, will never have influenced it. And that means that almost no one even remembers me.	game/tutorial.rpy	99	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_b6b000f5	beud	After that, I waited for what felt like eons before I couldn't take the loneliness anymore.	game/tutorial.rpy	100	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_e382afa1	beud	I've actually come to understand Xenos a little during that time.	game/tutorial.rpy	101	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_01ad11d5	beud	At first, I thought he simply cast away Mordecai, his heart, because he viewed it as unnecessary.	game/tutorial.rpy	104	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_94461f99	beud	But now I think there was more to it. Being alone here, sealed away, is unimaginably lonely and miserable.	game/tutorial.rpy	105	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_253cfbc6	beud	If I knew how to cast away my own heart and stop feeling, I would have been tempted to myself.	game/tutorial.rpy	106	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_c89c1e89	beud	Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and searched around in this vast sea of emptiness between the worlds for anything to connect to.	game/tutorial.rpy	109	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_54d94d97	beud	Something that, for instance, Xenos wouldn't be able to corrupt through me.	game/tutorial.rpy	110	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_c44ece10	beud	And... as it happens, I made some really interesting discoveries.	game/tutorial.rpy	113	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_1dccaa9f	beud	Firstly, I realized that, since Xenos was only ever interested in controlling everything, he didn't care about the portions of this place that were outside his influence.	game/tutorial.rpy	116	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_7c2d49e2	beud	But I probed around a bit, and it turns out that what I thought was the edge of the universe was actually an interface between this cluster of universes with a much vaster sea of information.	game/tutorial.rpy	119	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_f6cbe36f	beud	This space of possibility and the worlds it contains appear to be a self-contained existence, and people here can't really cross out.	game/tutorial.rpy	120	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_c2efada9	beud	But outside, there are all kinds of worlds—many of which are more boring than the world I come from, and some of which are even more wild.	game/tutorial.rpy	121	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_cb0ea9dc	beud	And after sifting through some of that external information, I found out that this particular multiverse has creators even older than Xenos and Bahamut.	game/tutorial.rpy	122	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_8187c4a6	beud	A whole bunch of them, actually, so much so that the people on the outside have conglomerated them into a whole business.	game/tutorial.rpy	123	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_2f1654a9	beud	I can tell you're from the outside, aren't you?	game/tutorial.rpy	124	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_7c392478	beud	And where you're from, you refer to my cluster of universes as a continuity called "Dragalia Lost," right?	game/tutorial.rpy	125	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_d2c2856b	beud	I thought so. Anyway, apparently the people on the outside had a whole variety of motives for making this universe.	game/tutorial.rpy	126	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_1d3ea1b6	beud	A lot of developers poured tons of love into my world, but one primary motivation was the business of telling my story to entertain people through...	game/tutorial.rpy	127	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_7bda15a4	beud	...well, I guess you would call it a "mobile game?"	game/tutorial.rpy	132	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_686bbd30	beud	Anyway, apparently the costs of keeping my world going were barely less than the money they were making.	game/tutorial.rpy	134	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_f743afc8	beud	So the two main parties, "Nintendo" and "Cygames," made the decision to shut it down. In fact, I think that's why Xenos actually manifested as an entity at all—to "end" the "game."	game/tutorial.rpy	135	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_3fe74a28	beud	I honestly don't even think Xenos realizes the role that was assigned to him. He's never had interest in anyone outside himself, to be frank.	game/tutorial.rpy	136	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_4002d444	beud	In any case, I wouldn't want the people who created me to go out of business, so I can't blame them too much.	game/tutorial.rpy	139	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_70954c0f	beud	...After all, if there's anyone who would understand the amount of attention and energy it takes to keep an entire world running, it would be me...	game/tutorial.rpy	144	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_d9a9d218	beud	But at the same time, I didn't want my friends and I to disappear entirely. Even if they don't remember me, I love all my friends very dearly.	game/tutorial.rpy	148	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_f38e03a0	beud	So that's when I resolved to see if I could use anything from the outside world to hold it together.	game/tutorial.rpy	149	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_d9e5b85d	beud	As it happened, all the places and people I knew were preserved as "assets" or "files" inside the sea of information.	game/tutorial.rpy	152	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_d8515d21	beud	So... well, since the world ended anyway, I figured nobody would mind if I borrowed them, right?	game/tutorial.rpy	155	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_dfa68a27	beud	But those things are just like... well, a skeleton. They're basically images and sounds, but there's no "life" in them.	game/tutorial.rpy	156	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_28e54ff6	beud	That's why I needed to find a way to breathe life into them, using the power of creation.	game/tutorial.rpy	159	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_adc2691f	beud	And in order to use the power of creation on things from the outside worlds, I needed a different method than what I was used to.	game/tutorial.rpy	160	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_570c2c0e	beud	I couldn't just say "In the name of the first" and have everything magically come together. It's sort of like I needed a different... well, language.	game/tutorial.rpy	163	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_spoilers_4b637cda	beud	So ultimately, I did some digging and found this framework, which is how I'm interacting with you right now. Does that make sense?	game/tutorial.rpy	164	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_8db3dc56	beud	The place we're currently in is a type of semantic rigging constructed using a language of creation I borrowed from your world—it's called "Ren'Py."	game/tutorial.rpy	173	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_70360f85	beud	I've... heard that the term comes from the Japanese term "ren'ai," which means "romantic love", and... er, "Python...?"	game/tutorial.rpy	178	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_578b17f9	beud	Which is apparently a DIFFERENT language for creation? For a... "computer?"	game/tutorial.rpy	179	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_d2ae3d27	beud	—Anyway, apparently it was originally made for something called "dating sims" and then branched out into a more generic "visual novel engine".	game/tutorial.rpy	181	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_ca3df2ab	beud	I don't really get all the details, since there wasn't anything like this back in my world, but apparently you can use it to piece together "assets" and bring a "story" to life.	game/tutorial.rpy	182	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_35c28f4f	beud	Suffice it to say, Ren'Py works a lot like the underpinnings of my old world did, and it means I was able to take the "skeleton" of the world I used to know and put an artificial "spirit" into it.	game/tutorial.rpy	185	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_fb5e9169	beud	That being said, you're accessing this place from the outside, so that means you probably have an even greater aptitude for using this new language of "creation" than I am.	game/tutorial.rpy	186	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_04ef7896	beud	Oh! I've never had anyone here before, so why don't you try using the language of "Ren'Py" to... well, create something?	game/tutorial.rpy	191	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_30cb3220	beud	Let's see... for starters, why don't we make a place for us to chat?	game/tutorial.rpy	195	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_f6738071	beud	I mean... I'm sure it would be better than floating around here in this chaotic space, right?	game/tutorial.rpy	198	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_fd541396	beud	Here, I'll help you out. Lemme take a look here... so the "asset" corresponding to the Halidom's main hall is called...	game/tutorial.rpy	201	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_c670457a	beud	...Uhh... this is a mouthful... "Sty_bg_0024_100_00.png". I pinched it off and saved it in a "folder" called "images/backgrounds".	game/tutorial.rpy	204	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_0b492c01	beud	...Maybe I should help you out here. I'll define the image for you, so all you have to do is say "scene" to dissolve away everything around us into the new "setting."	game/tutorial.rpy	207	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_6dfbe8db	beud	..."image halidom_hall = "images/backgrounds/Sty_bg_0024_100_00.png"!	game/tutorial.rpy	211	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_5a16613a	beud	Whew, ok. So now that that's set up, you just need to say "scene halidom_hall with dissolve".	game/tutorial.rpy	216	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_f93f3760	beud	Whenever you're ready, go ahead and try.	game/tutorial.rpy	218	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_no_spoilers_dd0025a9	beud	Oh!! It's working!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	225	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_8be2dce0	beud	Wow, this is fantastic! This already feels so much more like home!	game/tutorial.rpy	243	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_8c328297	beud	Do you... uh... mind if I change into something more comfortable? This whole 'bondforged' thing doesn't really... uh... fit with the aesthetic?	game/tutorial.rpy	249	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_d7150c9d	beud	I'm gonna 'hide' myself for a second and come back in a different form.	game/tutorial.rpy	251	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_efc2af7c	beud	"hide beuden with dissolve".	game/tutorial.rpy	252	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_446facbc	beud	Ok, I'm coming back. So...	game/tutorial.rpy	256	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_5410f09f	beud	"show euden with dissolve".	game/tutorial.rpy	257	beud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_cb2657ac	eud	Whew! I'm back!	game/tutorial.rpy	260	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_061c0a5f	eud	Wow, this is so nostalgic. Dressing like this, being in the Halidom... it's just like old times!	game/tutorial.rpy	263	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_09ebab47	eud	And... I'm... even welcoming a new friend here.	game/tutorial.rpy	266	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_27f3d93f	eud	...	game/tutorial.rpy	271	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_ccb55bcc	eud	...I'm sorry, I'm just feeling a little emotionally overwhelmed right now.	game/tutorial.rpy	276	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_1ff16de1	eud	It's nice to be talking to someone, but... I miss my friends so much...	game/tutorial.rpy	277	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_27f3d93f_1	eud	...	game/tutorial.rpy	280	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_b9aa107d	eud	...I'm sorry, but I'd really like you to try something.	game/tutorial.rpy	281	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_e344c9ab	eud	Despite my abilities, it's really difficult for me to use the language of "Ren'py."	game/tutorial.rpy	282	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_d4876a7b	eud	But... together, we might be able to do things that I can't do by myself.	game/tutorial.rpy	283	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_8e607458	eud	So... could you try to bring back my friend Notte for me? Please!	game/tutorial.rpy	286	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_e1da1c55	eud	I know the words, but it doesn't respond for me.	game/tutorial.rpy	287	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_abfe3d93	eud	Please, can you at least try to say them with me?	game/tutorial.rpy	288	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_09360632	eud	H-Here goes...	game/tutorial.rpy	292	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_halidom_ec364226	eud	"show notte with dissolve"	game/tutorial.rpy	295	eud "[what]" nointeract
tutorial_start_notte_27f3d93f	eud	...	game/tutorial.rpy	306	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_a29befde	nott	...(Yawn) What's going on?	game/tutorial.rpy	312	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_6ca4cd28	nott	...?	game/tutorial.rpy	317	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_9e7e950f	nott	...Wait, are you...?	game/tutorial.rpy	320	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_27f3d93f_1	eud	...	game/tutorial.rpy	325	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_74e74638	eud	You're... you're really here...	game/tutorial.rpy	326	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_abeaaf6d	nott	...You're EUDEN!! SWEET HOPPING HALIDOM!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	333	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_bd1d6f98	nott	What are you—wait, what am I—?!?	game/tutorial.rpy	337	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_30cfa2e7	nott	I-I remember everything! I can't believe I forgot you!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	343	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_04e96ad0	nott	I'm so sorry, I can't believe I let myself forget about you!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	347	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_27f3d93f_2	eud	...	game/tutorial.rpy	352	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_ec41ee26	eud	Notte... I'm... (sniff) I'm just so happy to see you...!	game/tutorial.rpy	355	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_80c58191	eud	I never thought I'd see you again!	game/tutorial.rpy	356	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_9a08b369	nott	W-Well, (sob) I missed you TOO, doofus!!! How could you just act like that and decide to save the world by making us all forget you!!	game/tutorial.rpy	361	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_f9f0db9c	nott	(Sniffle) Nobody wanted that, you—you big dummy!!! T-That's it, you're SO getting a Notte Ball, mister!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	366	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_a2d5a6bb	eud	Well, the thing is— OUCH! N-Notte, come on, I get that you're upset, but...!	game/tutorial.rpy	374	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_660893f1	eud	Ow! Notte, your hair is so spiky!	game/tutorial.rpy	377	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_97a08440	nott	(Sniffle) Yeah, it is!! And you—you thought you could just make me forget all about you scott-free?! (Sob) We're best BUDS, mister!!	game/tutorial.rpy	382	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_6c398625	nott	Or I THOUGHT so, anyway!!! Take this, and this!! It's my wrath of friendship!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	385	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_e1eb9e6e	eud	Oof!	game/tutorial.rpy	391	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_5a9c9ee4	eud	H-Hey, uh, you there... I'm sorry to do this after you just did all this for me, but... maybe you could give us a few minutes here?	game/tutorial.rpy	394	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_c8c61ecb	eud	—Ack! Have you been working out or something, Notte!? That seriously stings!	game/tutorial.rpy	400	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_05326d06	eud	—A-Anyway, I clearly have my hands full catching up with Notte here (wince), so, uh, let's meet up after a few minutes to talk more about how to use Ren'Py's power of creation—	game/tutorial.rpy	406	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_a229dd22	nott	Why don't you 'create' a less selfish ATTITUDE for yourself, mister?!? "Ohh, I'm Euden, I have to save the world! WELP, guess I'll just gonna make my friends casually think I never EXISTED!!" I am SO mad right now! HIYAAAAH!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	414	nott "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_7f3c5623	eud	OW! All right, I GET it, I GET it!! I'm sorry for making you forget, ok?	game/tutorial.rpy	420	eud "[what]"
tutorial_start_notte_5a7b18a9	eud	A-Anyway, see you soon, new friend, and—YEOUCH!—thanks for trying out the Dragalia Lost Story Engine!!	game/tutorial.rpy	425	eud "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_36671bb9	eud	Oh, hello, you're back!	game/tutorial.rpy	468	eud "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_3e39e655	eud	Sorry for the commotion back there... I think Notte's finally calmed down a bit.	game/tutorial.rpy	471	eud "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_de106935	nott	It's not like I didn't have a good reason, you doofus! You're always doing stuff like this!	game/tutorial.rpy	478	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_11f28838	nott	I mean... going off alone and "sacrificing yourself" for "everyone else's sake" when we're all just worrying our heads off about YOU?!	game/tutorial.rpy	480	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_d75725c6	nott	Rrrgh! Would it KILL you to have have just a LITTLE more self-preservation instinct?	game/tutorial.rpy	485	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_416c08a5	nott	...But... I AM crazy-happy to see you again, obviously...	game/tutorial.rpy	491	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_a5646e02	nott	So, uh... where ARE we exactly? It looks like the main hall of the Halidom, but... I've tried flying around, and I can't actually leave.	game/tutorial.rpy	497	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_c6ef5071	eud	Well, that's actually a great point. This is a 'background' that our friend here made for us.	game/tutorial.rpy	503	eud "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_870a21c4	eud	It captures a specific place from our journeys and displays it around us.	game/tutorial.rpy	504	eud "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_9b4c75e9	nott	Oh, neat! So it's kind of like we're on a stage and it's, uh... what do you call it? A backdrop?	game/tutorial.rpy	511	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_1d88c512	eud	Exactly! And whenever our friend wants, they can change it to a different one.	game/tutorial.rpy	517	eud "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_85562236	nott	Oooh! Oooh! In that case, take us somewhere with lots of YUMMY TREATS! All this remembering has made me SUPER hungry!	game/tutorial.rpy	524	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_dee558de	eud	Whoa, easy there, Notte, it's not that simple. Last time, I made the background for our friend here; I'm not sure they know how to do it on their own.	game/tutorial.rpy	532	eud "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_7cb5c3ce	nott	Well, that's an easy fix, then! Just tell them how to work their magic, and PRESTO CHANGEO! Notte gets her sugar fix!	game/tutorial.rpy	538	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_f89f4db3	nott	OOH, OOH! Take us to the Sweet Retreat from Halloween!!! The whole gosh-darn THING is made of CANDY!	game/tutorial.rpy	543	nott "[what]"
tutorial_bgs_55d99370	eud	Well, actually, that does sound really fun. And I'm sure YOU want to come as well? In that case, I'll help you change the backgrounds.	game/tutorial.rpy	549	eud "[what]"
tutorial_defining_backgrounds_b3ea8e97	eud	First of all, you need to actually have a background image to use. For our purposes, I've been putting them all in the file "images/backgrounds".	game/tutorial.rpy	553	eud "[what]"
tutorial_defining_backgrounds_f0d0c563	eud	There's actually a bunch of other folders under "images," but we won't worry about it for right now.	game/tutorial.rpy	554	eud "[what]"
tutorial_defining_backgrounds_24916816	eud	Hmm... do I even HAVE the Sweet Retreat as a file?	game/tutorial.rpy	559	eud "[what]"
tutorial_defining_backgrounds_8020355f	eud	Ah, here it is. "Sty_bg_0027_102_00.png"	game/tutorial.rpy	563	eud "[what]"
tutorial_defining_backgrounds_221bbdcf	eud	And yes, I know the name is super weird. I think it's ripped straight from the original data of the world.	game/tutorial.rpy	564	eud "[what]"
tutorial_defining_backgrounds_f647c681	eud	Do you want to hear about the file naming conventions? You don't REALLY have to know the details, it's more for curiosity's sake.	game/tutorial.rpy	565	eud "[what]"
tutorial_defining_backgrounds_d7ae86f3	eud	Oh, sure! I guess it IS best to be thorough, after all...	game/tutorial.rpy	570	eud "[what]"
tutorial_defining_backgrounds_9bf37930	eud	Sure thing. Like I said, it's not really that important.	game/tutorial.rpy	574	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_name_conventions_7d7bef2c	eud	From what I can tell, there's 3 sets of numbers. The first four-digit one refers to a specific location ("0027" here, the Halidom lawn).	game/tutorial.rpy	579	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_name_conventions_0e6b9b14	eud	The second one ("102" in this case) refers to the time of day or the state of things in the image. For instance, in this one the Sweet Retreat is fully built and it's daytime.	game/tutorial.rpy	580	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_name_conventions_edb5814a	eud	And the third one ("00") is used if there's multiple parts that come together to make the scene. Some backgrounds are actually composite images, but in this case ours is a single image.	game/tutorial.rpy	581	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_name_conventions_40dbbc6f	eud	Anyway, all of this is to say, "the files have weird names from the original game, but the numbers mean something." As long as you can view the images, though, it shouldn't be a problem in selecting one.	game/tutorial.rpy	582	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_1e359a66	eud	In any case, after you've got the image file, you need to make a statement to tell Ren'Py that it's an image you want to use, and to save it in memory.	game/tutorial.rpy	588	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_d1cefe70	eud	You do this by using an 'equals' (=) statement that defines the file.	game/tutorial.rpy	589	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_76c392ec	eud	In this case, it's an 'image' file, so we'll precede it with 'image.'	game/tutorial.rpy	590	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_2e00add2	eud	Next you need to come up with a name that you want to CALL the file within the program. This is called a 'variable' name.	game/tutorial.rpy	591	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_a6078399	eud	It's generally good convention to name it in lowercase. OH! And you can't use SPACES in a variable name.	game/tutorial.rpy	592	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_b9380b5c	eud	If you put a space between two words, Ren'Py will think that you're using two separate names. Underscores are a good workaround.	game/tutorial.rpy	593	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_6f0c8f58	eud	For our purposes, let's name the file... uh... 'sweet_retreat'?	game/tutorial.rpy	594	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_838b6aa3	eud	And last but not least, you follow the 'equals' sign (=) with the file pathway name in QUOTES. That's very important; it tells Ren'Py to input the file pathway as a string of characters.	game/tutorial.rpy	595	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_20453850	eud	To put things simply, you just need to say: image sweet_retreat = "images/backgrounds/Sty_bg_0027_102_00.png"	game/tutorial.rpy	598	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_81b74a61	eud	Are you ready to try it, or do you want to hear that again?	game/tutorial.rpy	599	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_96dd3651	eud	Perfect! I think it worked!	game/tutorial.rpy	605	eud "[what]"
tutorial_background_no_name_conventions_1632e836	eud	No worries; I know this is a lot to process in one hearing.	game/tutorial.rpy	610	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_background_5f91dcf0	eud	In that case, the next thing you need to do is tell the program to display the background.	game/tutorial.rpy	616	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_background_d619803a	eud	This is a lot easier than defining the image; just like last time, you just say the 'scene' statement.	game/tutorial.rpy	617	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_background_b4a8559d	eud	That tells Ren'Py to change the background. And then you just follow it by the 'variable' name you chose for the background.	game/tutorial.rpy	618	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_background_38e00728	eud	In this case, it would be "scene sweet_retreat".	game/tutorial.rpy	619	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_background_2ef1714a	eud	Why don't you try it now?	game/tutorial.rpy	620	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_background_f732ed45	nott	Yeah, do it!! Bring on the sugar rush!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	627	nott "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_edf4d417	nott	Eep!!! Holy moly! What in the heck just happened??	game/tutorial.rpy	642	nott "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_526534d9	nott	We just appeared here before I even got a chance to blink!	game/tutorial.rpy	643	nott "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_3fbb51b8	eud	Yeah... I forgot to mention that the default 'scene' statement just instantaneously changes the background.	game/tutorial.rpy	651	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_4c286ff6	eud	The transition can certainly be a little... jarring.	game/tutorial.rpy	652	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_c6e8f124	nott	Well, thanks for the heads-up, Euden! I swear I'm gonna have a tiny fairy heart-attack over here!	game/tutorial.rpy	660	nott "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_f1a6e8d5	eud	Sorry, sorry... Uh, why don't I tell you how to make the transition a little cleaner?	game/tutorial.rpy	666	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_d12dfeb4	eud	Last time you did this, I had you add the phrase 'with dissolve', which causes the previous image to blend gradually into the upcoming one.	game/tutorial.rpy	669	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_1ab41fbb	eud	But let's try for something different. Here, I'll define a different image for you. I always thought the Sweet Retreat was prettier at night, anyway.	game/tutorial.rpy	670	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_f0efe1c0	eud	Let's call it... sweet_retreat_night.	game/tutorial.rpy	671	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_change_03cc495f	eud	This time, try saying 'scene sweet_retreat_night with fade'. The 'fade' statement makes things transition to black and then come back with the new image.	game/tutorial.rpy	676	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_fade_c80a6664	nott	Whoa! It became night! And it wasn't so shocking this time!	game/tutorial.rpy	688	nott "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_fade_9b698969	eud	Yeah, great job! This looks fantastic. Did you see how the 'fade' statement made the transition a little cleaner?	game/tutorial.rpy	694	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_fade_add910a2	nott	Oh, yeah!!! Major kudos! But let's dig in first!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	701	nott "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_fade_0812b1fc	nott	(Monch) Mmmmmm... oh my gosh, it tastes so good! So sweet! Aaahhh, I love candy! (Nom)	game/tutorial.rpy	707	nott "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_fade_9cabd05d	eud	Haha, I'm glad you like it so much.	game/tutorial.rpy	713	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_fade_3b8679b6	eud	And... as for you over there, does that make sense, or do we need to go through that again?	game/tutorial.rpy	715	eud "[what]"
tutorial_successful_bg_fade_fbafc2e2	eud	No worries! You should keep trying until you feel comfortable with it.	game/tutorial.rpy	723	eud "[what]"
tutorial_done_with_bgs_37982c0f	eud	That's great! You're a real natural at this! I can't wait to see what kind of things you'll be capable of in the future!	game/tutorial.rpy	730	eud "[what]"
tutorial_done_with_bgs_b2e0a9f2	nott	Forget the future, I want more treats NOW! (gobble)	game/tutorial.rpy	737	nott "[what]"
tutorial_done_with_bgs_3fc0094d	eud	Uh, are you sure? If you keep eating at this rate, you're gonna get bloat—	game/tutorial.rpy	745	eud "[what]"
tutorial_done_with_bgs_2bb32af7	nott	(PLOP!)	game/tutorial.rpy	756	nott "[what]"
tutorial_done_with_bgs_3a849bf8	nott	...	game/tutorial.rpy	762	nott "[what]"
tutorial_done_with_bgs_87b34243	eud	..Oh dear, it looks like I'm already too late...	game/tutorial.rpy	770	eud "[what]"
tutorial_done_with_bgs_6313b0cf	eud	Uh... well, it looks like Notte's gonna be out of commission for a while, so let's... take five and meet back up?	game/tutorial.rpy	776	eud "[what]"
tutorial_done_with_bgs_2cc30731	eud	Ha... Haha...	game/tutorial.rpy	777	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_89a0cef7	nott	...Whew, I think I'm finally through the stomache cramps! Lesson learned; from now on, it's salads and portion control for ol' Notte!	game/tutorial.rpy	819	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_1d2f8808	eud	Yeah, I'll say... I was worried you were going to explode for a second there!	game/tutorial.rpy	825	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_cb6cabe8	nott	Yeah... I kinda went a little overboard... Turns out an entire Sweet Retreat is KIND of something to share with a bunch of people, not to eat solo....	game/tutorial.rpy	832	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_6677735f	nott	Speaking of though, isn't it kind of a bit lonely with just the two of us here?	game/tutorial.rpy	836	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_91b44507	nott	—Ah, whoops! I mean the THREE of us. Sorry about that, new friend over there.	game/tutorial.rpy	841	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_0ce7795b	eud	Well, actually, that's exactly what I wanted to talk about next. Now that we've figured out how to bring Notte here, instantiating some of our other friends should be a lot easier the second time around.	game/tutorial.rpy	847	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_a2a3df63	nott	Oh, goody!!! Not that I'm not TOTALLY happy having some one-on-one time with Euden, of course! I just miss the other folks too, and if we brought them over here, that would really liven things up!	game/tutorial.rpy	851	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_c8c482a5	eud	I agree! And I think with our new friend helping, it should be super easy.	game/tutorial.rpy	856	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_4d29a5c0	eud	Now... I was thinking about someone in particular that I think we should bring first. Want me to surprise you, or should I just tell you now?	game/tutorial.rpy	859	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_fe98ea3b	nott	I dunno, do they happen to have long blonde hair, a flowy sash and a huge 'ahoge?' Perhaps a name that starts with a 'Z' and rhymes with "Schmethia"?	game/tutorial.rpy	864	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_d94646da	eud	Haha yeah, I guess you got me there... Not much of a surprise, huh?	game/tutorial.rpy	870	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_a9808532	nott	Well, duh, the three of us have been friends for our whole lives. I wanna see her too!	game/tutorial.rpy	875	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_19bd3f90	eud	Sure thing. In that case... Here, friend, I've got the procedure already pulled up for you.	game/tutorial.rpy	880	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_090eb315	eud	Characters work just like any other image, in that you can 'show' and 'hide' them.	game/tutorial.rpy	881	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_05c758ab	eud	And just like with backgrounds, you can use the 'dissolve' or 'fade' commands to alter the way a character appears on the screen when you 'show' them.	game/tutorial.rpy	882	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_705d76c8	eud	But unlike backgrounds, I already pre-defined the character's data into ".rpy" code files for you! Hopefully that makes things convenient?	game/tutorial.rpy	883	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_defd7b57	zeth	...Huh?	game/tutorial.rpy	897	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_8788faa0	zeth	What am I... Wait, Euden? And Notte?	game/tutorial.rpy	898	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_d9d70d9f	nott	ZETHIA! It's AMAZING to be able to see you again!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	904	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_1542be19	eud	...Yeah. Welcome home, Zethia.	game/tutorial.rpy	909	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_4dcd64ad	zeth	...Euden... and Notte... I'm... I'm so glad to see you all again...	game/tutorial.rpy	913	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_54d414de	zeth	...I don't even know how to express my feelings right now...	game/tutorial.rpy	914	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_8cd5a67a	nott	It's ok, girl! Let it all out!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	918	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_2d11ebe4	zeth	...No, as in, I LITERALLY have no idea how to express my feelings.	game/tutorial.rpy	925	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_639b0ed2	zeth	I... I feel like my face is frozen in this one expression. Hrrrrgh. It actually feels really unnatural. Please help.	game/tutorial.rpy	932	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_f6859b5d	eud	S-Sorry! T-This is embarrassing! I was so caught up in the moment that I forgot to help Zethia change her 'face' group when she started speaking.	game/tutorial.rpy	939	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_8c7e1407	nott	"Face group?" What even IS that? Hurry and help Zethia, I'm starting to freak out here.	game/tutorial.rpy	946	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_1b386ea5	eud	Y-Yeah, right away. But I might need some help from our friend here.	game/tutorial.rpy	952	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_1e054353	eud	Unlike backgrounds, characters are more complicated because they need a bunch of different animated assets.	game/tutorial.rpy	954	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_850d3267	eud	As a result, they've all been implemented as something called a "layeredimage", including me and Notte.	game/tutorial.rpy	955	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_55aba36f	eud	Layeredimages are useful because they allow you 1) to easily overlay components of composite images on top of each other...	game/tutorial.rpy	956	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_da989b6c	eud	...and 2) to sort image components into logical groups, each of which can be changed independently with keywords.	game/tutorial.rpy	957	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_075f02ee	eud	Layeredimages are built from the bottom up. Most 'character' layeredimages have a single sprite that comprises their 'body'.	game/tutorial.rpy	960	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_cd2c3ee6	eud	The other layers are then then overlaid on top of the 'body' image to alter its appearance and emotions.	game/tutorial.rpy	961	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_3ff5a559	eud	Usually, characters don't have 'body' GROUPS, but they might on occasion, so be sure to check. (Pia, for example, can switch between holding a book and having her hands empty).	game/tutorial.rpy	962	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_db184b48	eud	Anyway, whether or not the character has a body group, they'll almost always have a 'face' and a 'mouth' group. Each of those groups contains a set of similar components.	game/tutorial.rpy	963	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_7c57a7c4	eud	The 'face' group usually controls the character's eyes, and the 'mouth' group controls their mouth.	game/tutorial.rpy	964	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_f4b57d00	eud	And within each group, the related components have unique labels that allow you to access them with a keyword.	game/tutorial.rpy	965	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_7013fdd7	eud	So... if Zethia wants to be able to express her surprise and confusion at this unusual situation, for instance, you'll need to use a keyword to help her change her eyes and mouth.	game/tutorial.rpy	966	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_b1c372bd	eud	Why don't you try changing her eyes to 'surprised'?	game/tutorial.rpy	967	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_5814d049	zeth	Yes, please do, with all haste!	game/tutorial.rpy	973	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_fc402fc4	zeth	...How exactly does our friend do that?	game/tutorial.rpy	977	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_appears_d49bd723	eud	Oh, sorry. You actually just use the 'show' statement like usual, but instead of adding 'with dissolve', you can just follow it with the keyword. So in this case...	game/tutorial.rpy	982	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_surprised_9fae53db	zeth	Oh my, amazing! That's already so much better.	game/tutorial.rpy	995	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_surprised_632ed8d3	nott	But her mouth's still all frozen in that weird smile. Shouldn't we do something about that?	game/tutorial.rpy	1001	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_surprised_7a0c3f91	eud	Yes, do that again but use the 'frown1' mouth command. Same syntax; Ren'py's smart enough to figure out whether a part is in the 'face' or 'mouth' group.	game/tutorial.rpy	1005	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_surprised_12eb0361	eud	(However, that does mean that every part within a single layeredimage needs to have a unique name, F.Y.I.)	game/tutorial.rpy	1006	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_9fb31c96	zeth	Oh! That was fast!	game/tutorial.rpy	1017	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_1842e4af	zeth	Thank you! This is all a bit shocking, but at least my face feels less frozen.	game/tutorial.rpy	1018	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_5598be97	zeth	Are... these the only faces I'm able to make, though?	game/tutorial.rpy	1023	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_a5f8657c	eud	Of course not! I offloaded all of Zethia's "art assets," so there's a huge list of what she can do!	game/tutorial.rpy	1030	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_183c3f65	eud	Whenever I implement one of my friends, I put a "readme" section at the top of their character_procedures.rpy file.	game/tutorial.rpy	1031	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_f4571dcd	eud	As you can see, it lists all the different options and commands you can use for that character.	game/tutorial.rpy	1037	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_d66e3353	eud	A lot of these words, like 'relaxed', 'angry', 'sad', 'smile1', 'frown1', 'mutter1', etc. are consistent across multiple characters.	game/tutorial.rpy	1038	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_f5c4e84f	eud	This consistent language is valuable because, if the same command works for multiple characters, it makes writing a lot easier.	game/tutorial.rpy	1039	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_b1bdee63	eud	Of course, not all characters have every expression, and some have multiple of the same, so you need to be cognizant of that when writing.	game/tutorial.rpy	1040	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_1a491446	eud	Oh, I should also probably explain how this 'readme' works.	game/tutorial.rpy	1041	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_e963d4c7	eud	See, because each of these lines is preceded by a hashtag (#) on the left, those lines are "commented out" and Ren'py knows not to execute them as code.	game/tutorial.rpy	1042	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_9fb8bcae	eud	Creating useful, comprehensive 'readme's and then consulting them properly when writing is the key to effective implementation of characters.	game/tutorial.rpy	1043	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_5aefeda5	eud	And of course, you can use the # to make notes to yourself anywhere else in your code as well.	game/tutorial.rpy	1044	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_fc1740b5	eud	Oh! And as a side note, the parts for these characters automatically do dynamic blinking, and their mouth moves to match whatever text they happen to be saying.	game/tutorial.rpy	1050	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_2d03e1f5	eud	If you want to implement characters that aren't already part of the provided file package, you'll need to learn how to write that procedure yourself, but that's a topic for later.	game/tutorial.rpy	1052	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_12e7e648	nott	Enough of the 'code' talk! Let's give this list of face words a whirl!	game/tutorial.rpy	1061	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_7b224ae3	nott	Let's see here... uhhh... "show zethia focused awkward1!"	game/tutorial.rpy	1063	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_b87fad40	zeth	Eeep! That tickles!	game/tutorial.rpy	1069	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_f564f046	nott	Hee hee! Looks like it worked!	game/tutorial.rpy	1074	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_49d2b4af	zeth	Hold on! Does this mean it's possible to change MULTIPLE facial parts as a list within a single "show" statement?	game/tutorial.rpy	1080	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_79e7bd25	eud	Uh— yeah, it is, I was planning to get into that... Aren't we getting a little ahead here, though? We should take it slowly and—	game/tutorial.rpy	1087	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_9332f939	nott	Oh oh! "show zethia grumpy pout1"!	game/tutorial.rpy	1094	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_41909772	zeth	Wh— Notte, this isn't funny!	game/tutorial.rpy	1101	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_b3be1b39	nott	Well, your face definitely LOOKS pretty funny! Ha ha ha ha!	game/tutorial.rpy	1108	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_348d80d9	nott	Oooh, and you even have {i}other{/i} expressions as well! I bet they're even sillier-looking!	game/tutorial.rpy	1112	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_83b669d3	nott	But... why did Euden bother to label them that way?	game/tutorial.rpy	1115	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_99d82d56	eud	What do you mean, "label them that way?" I thought the labelling was pretty consistent.	game/tutorial.rpy	1121	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_f90f0aed	nott	No, like, you literally had to REMIND yourself that she had other expressions? Like, 'other_angry1'. Isn't it already obvious that it's "another" expression?	game/tutorial.rpy	1125	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_d60de2d5	nott	Seems like bad labelling to me, but whatever. "show zethia other_angry1"—	game/tutorial.rpy	1127	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_a557040c	eud	No, Notte, wait, that's—!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1133	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_5949a335	zeth	...heh heh heh.	game/tutorial.rpy	1144	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_09deb32d	zeth	I thank you, foolish little fey creature. Your actions have finally released me from the prison of that wretched Auspex's mind.	game/tutorial.rpy	1150	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_515ef6a0	nott	...Wait, the label meant 'other' as in... THE Other?!?!?	game/tutorial.rpy	1156	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_142e017d	zeth	Indeed. And now that my metaphorical jail cell has been sprung, I'll be able to wreak all kinds of havoc upon this little hovel of a dimensional space. Ha ha ha haaaa!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1161	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_6ad5d259	nott	Jeepers creepers!!! Not this jerk again!!! We just got the Halidom back in order, too!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1171	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_a55e82be	nott	EUDEN, YOU COMPLETE DOOFUS!!! Why do you even HAVE 'The Other' face options for Zethia in the FIRST PLACE?!?!	game/tutorial.rpy	1177	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_bcdc7e9e	eud	I-I just grabbed all the image data on Zethia I could get, that's all! I'm still figuring this out, ok?!?	game/tutorial.rpy	1184	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_4ac48b3d	zeth	HAHAHAHAHA!!! BOW BEFORE ME, FOOLS!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1189	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_frown1_65da1e20	nott	Well, DO something!! Or what about our friend here? Quick, why don't YOU help us fix this!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1193	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_ca198253	zeth	Wait, what?!? You mean you can just DO tha—?!	game/tutorial.rpy	1206	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_43228960	eud	Whew... that was some quick thinking. Thanks for fixing the situation.	game/tutorial.rpy	1217	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_cec8ebe8	nott	Wait, what exactly is "fixed" about the situation? In case you haven't noticed, our friend just made Zethia DISAPPEAR!	game/tutorial.rpy	1226	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_318326d4	eud	W-Well, the thing is, that actually fixed the problem automatically. Once a 'layeredimage' disappears, all its 'group' settings get reverted to their defaults.	game/tutorial.rpy	1231	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_e1f55b38	eud	Or, at least, that's the case unless you explicitly name a different 'face' or 'mouth' when you 'show' it again.	game/tutorial.rpy	1232	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_622cebbd	nott	The defaults?... Oh, you mean those things labelled "default" in the readme? ...let's see, "relaxed" and "small_smile1"?	game/tutorial.rpy	1236	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_131aaf80	nott	OHHHH, I get it! So when Zethia comes back, she won't have those eyes of "The Other" anymore!	game/tutorial.rpy	1240	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_cfd9d9a5	nott	"show zethia with dissolve"!	game/tutorial.rpy	1242	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_64334bfa	zeth	My goodness, what a fright! Thanks so much for saving me!	game/tutorial.rpy	1248	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_6191fac7	nott	WHEW! She's back to normal! That was CRAZY!	game/tutorial.rpy	1253	nott "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_61dba52d	eud	Yeah... I guess the lesson here would be, "Always pay close attention to the readme?"	game/tutorial.rpy	1259	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_ab4042ea	eud	Since if you're not careful, the results may be... shocking... \nah ha ha...	game/tutorial.rpy	1260	eud "[what]"
tutorial_chars_zethia_hide_c7a9412b	eud	...How about we all take a little break and meet up later? ...I think I need to lie down...	game/tutorial.rpy	1263	eud "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_722569f7	nott	...Well, we've got the Halidom set up, Zethia's back, I'm over my tummyache and that whole 'other label' situation got fixed thanks to our friend here.	game/tutorial.rpy	1300	nott "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_bb724550	nott	Seems like we're pretty much all set now! So now we can just relax, sit back and have a nice chat.	game/tutorial.rpy	1302	nott "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_3a849bf8	nott	...	game/tutorial.rpy	1304	nott "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_375b17e3	zeth	...	game/tutorial.rpy	1307	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_27f3d93f	eud	...	game/tutorial.rpy	1310	eud "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_3a849bf8_1	nott	...	game/tutorial.rpy	1315	nott "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_f9b33ec5	nott	...Yeah, I got nothing.	game/tutorial.rpy	1320	nott "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_9b834eb9	nott	It's great that we're all together again, but now that we ARE, I'm not really sure what we should even TALK about! Things have been pretty wild.	game/tutorial.rpy	1323	nott "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_d6811d07	eud	...Yeahh, I feel the same way. I thought that things could just go back to normal as soon as I got you guys here, but a lot has happened since we last saw each other.	game/tutorial.rpy	1328	eud "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_1c60e426	eud	I don't even know what your lives have been like in the meantime.	game/tutorial.rpy	1330	eud "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_f97c2dc6	eud	To be honest, I'm kind of unsure what questions I should be asking...	game/tutorial.rpy	1331	eud "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_a31f99e1	zeth	...Well, perhaps we should let our new friend decide on a topic of conversation? They have done quite a lot for us lately, so it would only be fair.	game/tutorial.rpy	1337	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_72d905b6	eud	That's true. In that case, why don't YOU take point and lead the three of us through a quick chat?	game/tutorial.rpy	1341	eud "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_3091b254	eud	Ren'py's designed to be a visual novel engine, which means that the dialogue writing is SUPER streamlined.	game/tutorial.rpy	1342	eud "[what]"
tutorial_writing_dialogue_9258e84a	eud	All you have to do is use the character's 'sayer' tag followed by what you want them to say, in quotes.	game/tutorial.rpy	1343	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_84aa0feb		{color=#FF0000}An exception has occurred.{/color}	game/tutorial.rpy	1355	"[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_a253a302		{color=#FF0000}Exception: Sayer 'euden' is not defined.{/color}	game/tutorial.rpy	1356	"[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_e1b7758d	nott	Eeek! Everything went dark! What happened?	game/tutorial.rpy	1358	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_0ae40bd1	eud	Oops! I think Ren'py crashed. Lemme reboot the world really quickly...	game/tutorial.rpy	1360	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_27f3d93f	eud	...	game/tutorial.rpy	1362	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_09c2b5b5	eud	There we go, ahaha... I should have warned you that 'euden' is my LAYEREDIMAGE name, not my 'sayer' name.	game/tutorial.rpy	1370	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_5b098c05	nott	...Well, why can't you just make them BOTH 'euden'?	game/tutorial.rpy	1377	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_af98cbab	eud	Well, that's because 'euden' is already referring to an image of me. If Ren'py tried to use 'euden' to write DIALOGUE, it wouldn't know what to do...	game/tutorial.rpy	1382	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_822cbbc8	eud	And if you tried to redefine 'euden' as a 'sayer' with a separate statement, it could even make my image disappear.	game/tutorial.rpy	1383	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_26e5482c	eud	...Also, since characters sometimes say a lot of lines in a row, you could wind up typing the 'sayer' name a lot. So it's nice for the 'sayer' name to be short.	game/tutorial.rpy	1384	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_b3bdc151	eud	Anyway, if you want to make me say dialogue, my 'sayer' tag is 'eud,' NOT 'euden.' Likewise, Notte's is 'nott' and Zethia's is 'zeth'.	game/tutorial.rpy	1385	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_a60dfb83	nott	Ohhh, well, I guess that makes sense then... 'Eud,' my dude?	game/tutorial.rpy	1391	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_cddc3662	eud	Uh, well, you don't have to CALL me 'Eud' when you're talking to me. The program kind of just ignores everything in the quotes and assumes it's dialogue...	game/tutorial.rpy	1396	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_6188ecf1	eud	It's only when making commands in Ren'py OUTSIDE quotation marks that 'euden' vs. 'eud' makes a difference.	game/tutorial.rpy	1397	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_no_58b989c9	eud	A-Anyway, why don't you just try that dialogue thing again?	game/tutorial.rpy	1400	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_yes_0307b377	eud	You did it correctly!	game/tutorial.rpy	1407	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_yes_0a7661ec	nott	Whoa, it really worked!	game/tutorial.rpy	1411	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_yes_67704fba	eud	Absolutely! And you might have noticed that my lips moved automatically when our friend had me say that.	game/tutorial.rpy	1414	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_yes_2da20e55	eud	That's because everyone's layeredimages are designed to recognize whether their corresponding 'sayer' is talking or not...	game/tutorial.rpy	1415	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_yes_71e50770	eud	...and if the 'sayer' IS talking, this story engine will make 'lip flap' happen on their layeredimage while that character's dialogue is actively scrolling.	game/tutorial.rpy	1416	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_yes_b2dde540	zeth	That's impressive. With things implemented this way, dialogue looks totally natural!	game/tutorial.rpy	1420	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_yes_7bfdb2f3	eud	Absolutely. And it should be fairly natural to write, now, too.	game/tutorial.rpy	1424	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_euden_yes_05299413	eud	So... now that you know how to use our 'eud,' 'nott' and 'zeth' sayers to make dialogue, why don't you lead us in that conversation?	game/tutorial.rpy	1426	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part1_1790779b	eud	Ok. Zethia, how have things in Alberia been without me?	game/tutorial.rpy	1433	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part1_3f85a765	eud	(That's great! Now have Zethia reply to me!)	game/tutorial.rpy	1436	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part2_60dc24fc	zeth	Well, things have been keeping me pretty busy as Alberia's Auspex.	game/tutorial.rpy	1448	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part2_3e9692c3	zeth	...Hang on, can you guys see me? Something feels off.	game/tutorial.rpy	1453	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part2_caa57cb2	zeth	Hello?	game/tutorial.rpy	1454	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part2_332ce8ce	eud	Yeah, sorry, Zethia, I think the issue is your layeredimage wasn't shown first.	game/tutorial.rpy	1457	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part2_1847927c	eud	If you want to see Zethia talking, you need to use a 'show' statement to make her layeredimage 'zethia' appear, and THEN use 'zeth' to make her talk.	game/tutorial.rpy	1460	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part2_f8a03d8c	eud	...Although this was actually cool to see, because (as you might have noticed) my lips didn't move for ZETHIA's dialogue. That's the value of having separate speakers 'eud' and 'zeth'.	game/tutorial.rpy	1461	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part2_de98b1eb	eud	A-Anyway, why don't you try showing Zethia for the NEXT line? I'll step out of the way for you.	game/tutorial.rpy	1463	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part3_9bb00b51	zeth	I recently held an audience with Auspex Origa. It's good to see her without worrying about plots and schemes.	game/tutorial.rpy	1472	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part3_e5abc86b	zeth	...Ah! It worked! Astounding.	game/tutorial.rpy	1476	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part3_8a2adc99	nott	Oooh, ooh! I want a turn! Can I say something?	game/tutorial.rpy	1478	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part3_ba284a1f	nott	That shouldn't be hard for you, right?	game/tutorial.rpy	1479	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part4_61cb5260	nott	Wait, you should totally go shopping with her! With the two of you in solidarity, you could totally revamp the future of Auspex duds!	game/tutorial.rpy	1488	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part4_374a5b04	nott	Eek!!! Now I'm right smack-dab over Zethia's face!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1494	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part4_2b7c2898	zeth	Mmmfffmfmf.... Mfff!	game/tutorial.rpy	1498	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part4_afd6d890	nott	How do we fix this???	game/tutorial.rpy	1500	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part4_fda5a957	eud	Uh oh... I think our friend forgot to 'hide' Zethia first...	game/tutorial.rpy	1501	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part4_3d8cf6a2	nott	Hurry! She's gonna suffocate here!	game/tutorial.rpy	1502	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part5_e7676ad9	zeth	...Whew! I can breathe again!	game/tutorial.rpy	1513	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part5_4ffa10a7	nott	Man, that's a relief. I thought we were gonna have to get emergency surgery or something...	game/tutorial.rpy	1521	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part6_f3aa204f	eud	Oh? It looks like our friend wants me to say something?	game/tutorial.rpy	1533	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part6_94f68ea0	eud	...and, nice job with the 'hide'ing and 'show'ing, by the way. Very smooth.	game/tutorial.rpy	1534	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part7_f5d6fcef	eud	Notte, maybe you shouldn't say stuff like—	game/tutorial.rpy	1541	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part7_679f4b84		{color=#FF0000}Parsing the script failed.{/color}	game/tutorial.rpy	1547	"[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part7_88405728		{color=#FF0000}end of line expected.\neud "Notte, maybe you shouldn't be saying stuff like, " —> That shouldn't be hard for you, right?{/color}	game/tutorial.rpy	1548	"[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part7_bffe6e8f	nott	Oh no, not again! This time it looks like the dialogue didn't even get to RUN before it crashed!	game/tutorial.rpy	1550	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part7_445a8a82	eud	Ah... I think I see the problem. Our friend was trying to have me quote Notte, but with real quotation marks.	game/tutorial.rpy	1552	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part7_696792d1	eud	See, you can't use normal quotation marks inside the quote-text, since Ren'py will think you're closing out of the sentence, and that whatever comes afterwards is CODE.	game/tutorial.rpy	1553	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part7_79b3b894	eud	...Try doing the same thing, but this time, use the backslash (\\) before the quotation marks. It's a little weird, but just trust me.	game/tutorial.rpy	1554	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_a8e2a22c	eud	Notte, maybe you shouldn't say stuff like, "That shouldn't be hard for you, right?" Clearly this is trickier than it looks for our friend.	game/tutorial.rpy	1566	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_d4fd8228	eud	...Aha! There we go. The backslash (\\) character, which is sometimes called an "escape character," is used in blocks of quote-text like this to indicate special characters that shouldn't break the quote apart.	game/tutorial.rpy	1569	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_84988cba	eud	And it's not just for quotes. You can use the phrase \\n to tell Ren'py to break a quote up into two lines on a screen.\n\nLike this! See how the line went down to the next line? (I cheated and used two here.)	game/tutorial.rpy	1570	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_4039fc84	eud	Heck, you can even use \\\\ to tell Renpy to print a \\ on the screen!	game/tutorial.rpy	1571	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_02841e75	nott	Whoa, that's one powerful line! I can't believe it can do all that.	game/tutorial.rpy	1577	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_1ba83a18	nott	...Oh! But what if I want to CHANGE the text instead?	game/tutorial.rpy	1581	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_469628cd	eud	..."Change" the text? What do you mean?	game/tutorial.rpy	1586	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_abd85ed3	nott	Oh, well, like... if I wanted my dialogue to be pretty and pink, like a strawberry! Black is boring, right?	game/tutorial.rpy	1590	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_f7ca2feb	eud	Ohhhh, you mean FORMATTING TAGS. Yeah, those are super useful! You indicate THOSE with curly brackets. That is to say, { and }.	game/tutorial.rpy	1594	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_e54b3b88	eud	To change the color of text like you're talking about, you have to put a {color} statement at the beginning of your phrase, and a \n{/color} statement at the end.	game/tutorial.rpy	1595	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_ab8d421d	eud	The forward slash in {/color} tells Ren'py that it's REMOVING a formatting that was applied previously with {color}.	game/tutorial.rpy	1596	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_1fbb0d44	eud	Of course, you have to actually SAY the color you want to use, through hex code. So, for pink specifically, you'd say something like {color=#F81894}, then the text you want to color, then end with {/color}.	game/tutorial.rpy	1597	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part8_c031edd7	eud	Why doesn't our friend give you a hand with that, actually?	game/tutorial.rpy	1598	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_6305c49d	nott	{color=#F81894}Radical! Now my words can be as sweet as strawberries!{/color}	game/tutorial.rpy	1609	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_7ff64bd4	nott	Whoa, it really worked! My dialogue can become {color=#F81894}PINK{/color}!	game/tutorial.rpy	1610	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_a6fe2e5e	eud	Exactly! Formatting tags are useful for other stuff, too. They're very versatile.	game/tutorial.rpy	1614	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_95a9cb62	eud	For instance, you can put text in {i}{i}italics{/i}{/i}, you can {b}{b}bold{/b}{/b} text (although that doesn't look great in this font), or even {u}{u}underline{/u}{/u} it!	game/tutorial.rpy	1615	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_d0ada151	zeth	Wow, that's really impressive! Although you might have to be careful that you're not making too... {b}bold{/b} of a statement! Hee hee.	game/tutorial.rpy	1622	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_fcff5f71	eud	Wait, Zethia making a pun? That's rare to see.	game/tutorial.rpy	1626	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_48859793	eud	...Uh oh... Brace yourselves...	game/tutorial.rpy	1629	eud "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_d1008e5c	zeth	There's no need to be upset. Thanks to your instruction just now, I've simply developed a different... {i}slant{/i} on things than usual. I don't think there's any point in being {color=#0000FF}blue{/color} over some goofy {u}lines{/u}, is there?	game/tutorial.rpy	1634	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_45fe0b0a	nott	Oh no!!! We've unleashed Zethia's inner punster with these darn formatting tags!!! This'll go on forever!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1640	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_d54899dc	zeth	Well, that just won't do. You don't like these puns? Maybe you've... {color=#FF0000}RED{/color} them already?? HEE HEE!	game/tutorial.rpy	1647	zeth "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_18546f3c	nott	AAAAAAAAAAAUGH!!! This is somehow even WORSE than when she was the Other!	game/tutorial.rpy	1655	nott "[what]"
tutorial_dialogue_part9_138bf84b	nott	Cut! Fade to black! End the episode! Help!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1656	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_2c433fe7	nott	Hey, Euden! Now that we can bring our friends here and change the backgrounds, you know what we should do?	game/tutorial.rpy	1703	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_3ddd345e	nott	Let's throw a totally awesome party!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1708	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_9bd83b80	nott	I'm thinking we could make it a whole celebration, with food and music! Let's crank those tunes!	game/tutorial.rpy	1712	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_a3b56661	eud	Umm... but I'm not really sure how to play music or anything like that...	game/tutorial.rpy	1717	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_614ac076	nott	What? But you and your friend can do all this other amazing stuff! Surely it shouldn't be hard to DJ for us, right?	game/tutorial.rpy	1723	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_1633b01a	eud	Well, when you put it like that, it sounds reasonable... but the thing is, I don't even know where to start.	game/tutorial.rpy	1729	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_3773a163	eud	I guess I managed to download some files that SEEM like audio, but I'm not really much of a musician...	game/tutorial.rpy	1732	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_01459fa0	eud	I was mostly focused on the files for my friends and the places we've been... ahaha...	game/tutorial.rpy	1736	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_ef85d4af	nott	Well, if you don't know how to do it...	game/tutorial.rpy	1742	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_79cbfb7e	nott	...why don't you just call in somebody who DOES? I mean, we've got a LOT of musically-inclined friends, right?	game/tutorial.rpy	1747	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_4a73ad3d	eud	That's... actually not a bad idea.	game/tutorial.rpy	1753	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_b3b768ff	nott	Well, duh! Your old pal Notte's got a billion great ideas in her noodle!	game/tutorial.rpy	1759	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_a5bc1f02	nott	As far as who to ask... how about Maritimus? He runs a whole choir!	game/tutorial.rpy	1763	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_8e4a67b8	nott	Hey, you over there behind the screen! Why don't you pull up that fluffy ol' lump of dragon for us?	game/tutorial.rpy	1766	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_a2a6c93e	eud	UHHHH... Hang on, wait a minute!!! That's no good!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1772	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_5cecb98b	nott	What? Why?	game/tutorial.rpy	1778	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_ae87b4dd	eud	Well, if you're pulling up Maritimus... doesn't he specialize in CHORAL MUSIC?	game/tutorial.rpy	1783	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_da3c1526	nott	Well, yeah. Duh. What's the issue with that?	game/tutorial.rpy	1789	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_3b71955e	eud	Erm, well, vocal music could get us into trouble with 'copyright' law...	game/tutorial.rpy	1796	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_b5839462	nott	..."Copy Write" law? What's that?	game/tutorial.rpy	1802	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_5a023b95	eud	Um... well, it's hard to explain without getting too 'meta'... but... basically, we have to be respectful of the rules of the world our friend here is from, or we'll get into major trouble.	game/tutorial.rpy	1808	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_e1527575	eud	If we start ripping a bunch of .mp3's with vocals in them, the lawsuits will tear our dimension apart faster than you can say 'terms of service violation'...	game/tutorial.rpy	1810	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_16789152	nott	I... don't get any of that, but it sounds bad. Does that mean no music? Aww...	game/tutorial.rpy	1816	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_16e537e5	eud	Uh, well, maybe not music with LYRICS. Background music's... um... PROBABLY fine?	game/tutorial.rpy	1822	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_and_audio_3ca109a5	nott	Oh! Well, in that case, ol' Notte has the perfect idea! (scribbles) Here, new friend! Why don't you give THIS a whirl?	game/tutorial.rpy	1829	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_14ba819c	gio	AT LAST, I APPEAR!!! THE MAESTRO OF MUSIC GIOVANNI, CALLED BY YOUR {i}CONVOCAZIONE{/i}!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1844	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_058ae7f6	gio	I mean—ahem—hello...	game/tutorial.rpy	1848	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_863cec20	gio	Why, Euden, I haven't seen you in ages! How resourceful of you to call me! {i}Bravizzimo{/i}!	game/tutorial.rpy	1854	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_2852f034	eud	Haha, hello to you too, Giovanni! You seem as... uh... exuberant as ever!	game/tutorial.rpy	1862	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_6ce452e4	gio	Indeed! And with good reason, for it seems I have transcended time and space to appear in your presence once more! Such a miracle should be rightly celebrated, no?	game/tutorial.rpy	1869	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_d0c2ded9	nott	Yeah, you're right! It's great to see you, too, big guy! And... now that you're here, maybe you can tell us how to play these "audio files" Euden was talking about?	game/tutorial.rpy	1874	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_4b7252ca	gio	"Audio files?" How perplexing! Perhaps you should fill me in on the situation...	game/tutorial.rpy	1880	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_17f9c484	gio	I see, I see... Indeed, this is a most complex matter. You were wise to consult a professional of my caliber.	game/tutorial.rpy	1887	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_e1bd005a	gio	However, fear not! With my assistance, we will indeed plumb the depths of the musical world together!! {i}Coraggio{/i}, my friend!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1890	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_63f79c7c	gio	But first, a change of scenery is necessary! A musical medley is best suited for...	game/tutorial.rpy	1893	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_668ab9b1	gio	...THE THEATER!!! LET THE CURTAIN RISE ON THIS, OUR INAUGURAL PERFORMANCE!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1898	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_091451fb	nott	Eeek! Wait, now YOU can change backgrounds TOO?! This is already getting crazy!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1903	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_2e68bd99	gio	Ah, my fae friend, but music MUST be allowed to run wild in order for it to truly carry... {i}PASSIONE{/i}!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	1909	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_appears_8e84b97b	gio	In any case, now that the stage has been set, how can I lend my services to you all?	game/tutorial.rpy	1912	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_menu_72719714	gio	Certainly! One must always start from the basics and work upwards to greatness!	game/tutorial.rpy	1923	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_menu_9cb9200c	gio	Hmm... it seems like this section hasn't been built yet. Please be patient!	game/tutorial.rpy	1930	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_menu_514ec698	gio	Of course! Let us go on a tour through the wonderful world of voice acting!	game/tutorial.rpy	1935	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_menu_19709593	gio	...	game/tutorial.rpy	1936	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_menu_f9423058	gio	Oh dear... it seems like we don't actually HAVE any voice files at the moment...	game/tutorial.rpy	1940	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_menu_12393645	gio	However! If you have the initiative and a microphone, I am sure you and your friends can create wonderful voice lines to enrich your writing!	game/tutorial.rpy	1942	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_menu_64d90dfe	gio	...Erm... anyway, would you like to talk about something else?	game/tutorial.rpy	1943	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_4c6337dd	gio	Now, as I understand it, there are actually three different types of audio that can be played: {color=#FF0000}music{/color}, {color=#008000}sound{/color} and {color=#0000FF}voice{/color}.	game/tutorial.rpy	1958	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_36ce6da9	gio	Each of these exists as a separate 'channel,' and the three are overlaid to create the sounds that you hear.	game/tutorial.rpy	1960	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_da17336a	gio	The {color=#FF0000}music{/color} channel is used to play dulcet melodies and set the atmosphere for various theatrical events which you may depict through this story engine.	game/tutorial.rpy	1963	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_549c9152	gio	Meanwhile, the {color=#008000}sound{/color} channel is used to play sounds that accompany action and motion. The swish of a sword! The crash of an axe! The pattering of footsteps! All of these are a music of their own, setting the world in dynamic motion!	game/tutorial.rpy	1966	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_9cd90618	gio	Finally, the {color=#0000FF}voice{/color} channel is used to convey spoken dialogue. If you have the work of talented voice actors, you may use this channel to bring them to your listener's ears!	game/tutorial.rpy	1969	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_f52bd704	gio	Ah! I must convey something important: while the {color=#008000}sound{/color} and {color=#0000FF}voice{/color} channels play audio once and then terminate, the {color=#FF0000}music{/color} channel automatically LOOPS audio files that are played on it!	game/tutorial.rpy	1972	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_f5fca839	gio	This looping of the {color=#FF0000}music{/color} track is quite a useful feature; it allows background music to remain playing until a scripted time, since one doesn't know when the reader will advance the text.	game/tutorial.rpy	1973	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_8833ac6a	gio	As a result, music files in the {color=#FF0000}music{/color} channel should ideally be designed to loop, with the end connected musically back to the beginning {i}ad infinitum{/i}!	game/tutorial.rpy	1975	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_5994c089	gio	Such a feat of musicianship is quite invaluable for maintaining the audience's immersion, no? The composers of Dragalia Lost have already made a variety of wonderful, atmospheric tracks that function this way.	game/tutorial.rpy	1979	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_ca3361fe	gio	Now, all three of these channels can be manipulated using a number of simple commands. To change the audio status, simply use the command word followed by the channel you wish to affect.	game/tutorial.rpy	1982	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_giovanni_starts_explaining_335230fe	gio	Let us start with the 'stop' statement, which is used to mute the given channel. So: simply say 'stop music' to give our theater the pregnant silence which precedes a performance!	game/tutorial.rpy	1984	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_9a71ee8f	nott	Whoa! It really worked! It's almost spookily quiet now!	game/tutorial.rpy	1998	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_189740ff	gio	Yes, well... that may have been a bit jarring to immediately silence the audio like that.	game/tutorial.rpy	2005	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_10329c81	gio	However, never fear! {i}Coraggio{/i}! There exist 'fadeout' and 'fadein' tags which can be used to modify audio commands!	game/tutorial.rpy	2010	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_67e4cb9c	gio	Simply follow a statement such as 'stop music' with 'fadeout' followed by a decimal number to have the audio gradually fade out over that many number of seconds.	game/tutorial.rpy	2011	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_729b2873	gio	Likewise, the 'fadein' statement can be appended to certain commands to allow music to swell gradually from silence over a set number of seconds.	game/tutorial.rpy	2014	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_6e68163a	gio	Now... Let us raise the curtain on this musical extravaganza! I shall tell you how to play music!	game/tutorial.rpy	2017	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_1617a5e3	gio	Playing audio is as easy as a 'play' statement! To play it on the music track, for example, simply say "play music", followed by the file path in QUOTES.	game/tutorial.rpy	2019	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_84f3d3fc	gio	I shall be your conductor! For your first piece, you must play the title theme for Dragalia Lost with a 1-second fadein!	game/tutorial.rpy	2021	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_stop_music_77b48f08	gio	The file path is "audio/music/In A World That Never Ends (Dragalia Lost Main Theme) - Off-Vocals.mp3" Now, play! Play, my budding musician!	game/tutorial.rpy	2022	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_a41eb050	gio	YES! BRAVO!! BRAVISSIMO!!! This is indeed the (vocalless) main theme of Dragalia Lost, "In A World That Never Ends!"	game/tutorial.rpy	2035	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_f83ae5ea	gio	...although, what cruel irony! For indeed, the world of Dragalia Lost DID end, resulting in the situation we find ourselves in presently! Its own opening theme perjures the game's transient nature!	game/tutorial.rpy	2041	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_25798d5c	nott	Hey! Who said anything about it ending! Not on Notte's watch! We're gonna keep the good times rolling even if it's just in our little pocket dimension!	game/tutorial.rpy	2048	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_9b65c8f0	gio	Ah, my apologies! I did not mean to diminish your efforts! Rather, I think the fleeting nature of our time together makes our memories, and indeed these moments we now spend together, even more precious!	game/tutorial.rpy	2056	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_879286b5	eud	This is so nostalgic... This song makes me think of when I first set off on my journey. I never thought I'd wind up making so many wonderful friends, and having such exciting experiences!	game/tutorial.rpy	2063	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_9d17a4c7	gio	Indeed. The hopeful crescendos of this song are masterful, and capture that sentiment perfectly.	game/tutorial.rpy	2068	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_2cb2728b	gio	Ah... Even now I remember the first time we met. It was only a shame that we were so preoccupied with that business with Phantom Thief Lapis...	game/tutorial.rpy	2072	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_cdf466c2	gio	The shock I felt upon seeing the Halidom for the first time still remains with me... and the memory of Karina's wonderful aria brings me to the verge of tears...	game/tutorial.rpy	2076	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_d247b9b8	gio	...Ah, but—my apologies! I have forgotten myself in the throes of this music... as I am oft want to do, unfortunately...	game/tutorial.rpy	2081	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_d685fa4e	gio	You have, indeed, successfully used the 'play' command, which can take both 'fadein' (for the new track) and 'fadeout' (for cutting off the old track) statements.	game/tutorial.rpy	2085	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_28b9adbb	gio	Oh! I must note: the 'play' command immediately transitions out of whatever was playing before it the instant it takes effect.	game/tutorial.rpy	2087	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_e5c42007	gio	This means that if you write multiple 'play' statements in sequence without any dialogue to buffer, only the last song will actually play.	game/tutorial.rpy	2088	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_63201485	gio	If you want a song to play through in its entirety and then switch to a different song AFTER completion, that requires a different statement entirely!	game/tutorial.rpy	2090	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_6c611748	gio	Instead of 'play,' then, one must use the 'queue' command. This functions just like the 'play' statement, but waits for the current audio file to finish before starting.	game/tutorial.rpy	2094	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_5394e5b7	gio	And of course, the 'play', 'queue' and 'stop' commands can be used independently on the each of the three audio tracks, 'music,' 'sound,' and 'voice'.	game/tutorial.rpy	2095	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_0719457f	nott	Wow, you sure know a lot about music! I hope our friend can remember all that, because my brain's pretty bamboozled right now.	game/tutorial.rpy	2101	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_14f035a3	nott	Do YOU need him to repeat any of that?	game/tutorial.rpy	2102	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_73fb1191	gio	{i}Di certo{/i}, if there is anything you require me to go over again, I shall gladly oblige for the sake of your musicianship!	game/tutorial.rpy	2108	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_play_music_4c16518e	gio	Ah, my apologies... I have failed you as your musical mentor. Let me start from the top, then...	game/tutorial.rpy	2116	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_understand_stopplayandqueue_825d3a9d	gio	Good, good! Bellissimo! I could tell you were a quick study when I first gazed upon you!	game/tutorial.rpy	2124	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_understand_stopplayandqueue_b553a1db	gio	Yes, you shall become a true {i}virtuoso{/i} indeed! Ha ha haaaa!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	2128	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_understand_stopplayandqueue_f80c6abc	eud	Thanks so much for explaining all this. I certainly learned a lot already!	game/tutorial.rpy	2133	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_understand_stopplayandqueue_d3d39840	gio	Of course! It was my pleasure! After all, it is my vocation to help spread the gift of music to the world!!	game/tutorial.rpy	2138	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_understand_stopplayandqueue_20e9101a	gio	Now, is there anything ELSE that I can help to illuminate for you?	game/tutorial.rpy	2140	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_35ed55a9	gio	YES, {i}DI CERTO{/i}! I always have time to wax poetic over audio scores with those who show an interest and aptitude!!!	game/tutorial.rpy	2153	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_4102bf98	gio	As for you, my new friend, I knew right away that I was speaking with a kindred spirit!!	game/tutorial.rpy	2158	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_7f581aeb	gio	In that case, let us first go over songs with several story variations!	game/tutorial.rpy	2161	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_108584d1	gio	Now, one of the first things you should know is that many of the songs from the Dragalia Lost story soundtrack come from a talented Japanese artist named DAOKO.	game/tutorial.rpy	2164	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_f273f302	gio	In fact, the title theme you just played, "In A World That Never Ends," was performed by DAOKO, and the same goes for many of the upcoming songs as well.	game/tutorial.rpy	2167	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_e832f281	gio	Of course, it is a tragedy of the highest level that you will be unable to listen to DAOKO's wonderful voice. After all, her signature whisper-like raps have a unique tenderness to them which is utterly pleasant and draws the listener in!	game/tutorial.rpy	2170	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_2be3fbc1	gio	I cannot play them here for reasons Euden has explained to me, but I encourage you to listen to the vocal versions of the songs and support DAOKO's releases!	game/tutorial.rpy	2171	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_72763277	gio	In any case, I shall lead off with a tune which will be nostalgic to many fans of the Dragalia Lost mobile game—"CRASHER"!	game/tutorial.rpy	2174	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_e99eb128	gio	"CRASHER" by DAOKO, the theme which accompanied the heart-pounding High Dragon Trials, is a multifarious piece which lends itself well to a number of different adaptations.	game/tutorial.rpy	2179	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_2fe472ca	gio	This adaptation, "CRASHER (Story Version A)", creates an emotional and vulnerable mood with its gentle, swelling string section crescendos while chimes play the familiar melody. You can find it under the file name "CRASHER (Story Version A) loop.mp3".	game/tutorial.rpy	2182	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_7731ff3f	gio	This version, "CRASHER (Story Version B).flac", in contrast, creates a sense of oppression or ominousness through its heavy piano chords and slow tempo. For best results, {i}queue{/i} it after {i}play{/i}ing the intro file "CRASHER (Story Version B) intro.flac".	game/tutorial.rpy	2186	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_62b77f74	gio	Finally, this version, "CRASHER (Story Version C).flac" is closest to the feeling of the original battle theme, with fast-paced, pulsing synths. It's a great pick for action sequences! For best results, {i}queue{/i} it after {i}play{/i}ing the intro file "CRASHER (Story Version C) intro.flac".	game/tutorial.rpy	2190	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_7fdf1892	gio	Of course, CRASHER has a number of different settings besides the ones labelled "Story Version!"	game/tutorial.rpy	2193	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_9568da23	gio	For instance, this setting, "CRASHER (Story Bout C).flac", is a battle theme that keeps most of the energy of Story Version C but with more tension and urgency provided by the quick arpeggios and more classical instrumentation, with the melody played by flute.	game/tutorial.rpy	2196	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_a6035dc1	gio	This version, used for the mana circles menu, can be used to convey an air of mystery and magic. Its synthesized, drawn-out notes create a buzzing, electric atmosphere. You can find it under the file name "CRASHER Mana Circles loop.mp3".	game/tutorial.rpy	2199	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_a3990d34	gio	This version, used after quitting a quest in-game, conveys a sense of disappointment and brooding. The deep piano bass chords create a sense of heaviness, while the lilting rendition of the familiar melody creates a sense of limping and fragility. You can find it under the file name "CRASHER - Failure loop.mp3".	game/tutorial.rpy	2202	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_864d68a3	gio	Next is "BANG" by DAOKO, which is the famous (or maybe infamous, depending on your luck) jaunty tune which accompanied summoning in the game! Although it seems cutesy, the lyrics are actually surprisingly dark and contain mature themes...	game/tutorial.rpy	2209	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_96142b66	gio	This version you're hearing, "BANG (Story Version A).flac", is accompanied by a percussive intro. It follows the song's refrain and is often used in-game to denote celebrations or excitement. For best results, {i}queue{/i} it after {i}play{/i}ing the intro file "BANG (Story Version A) intro.flac".	game/tutorial.rpy	2211	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_351423c6	gio	In contrast, this rendition, "BANG (Story Version B).flac", is slightly more playful and comedic, with a more muted melody that replicates the background track of "BANG"'s verses. For best results, {i}queue{/i} it after {i}play{/i}ing the intro file "BANG (Story Version B) intro.flac".	game/tutorial.rpy	2215	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_4d8be2cc	gio	This song, based on the song Cinderella Step, is called "Cinderella Step (Story Version A) loop.mp3". It has a playful quality and features flutes and horns to create a whimsical, silly atmosphere perfect for humorous moments.	game/tutorial.rpy	2219	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_2841dab3	gio	This track, matching the verses of Yumemiteta no Atashi by DAOKO, is named "Yumemiteta no Atashi (Story Version A).flac". Its quiet, brooding synths with a bluesy feel is perfect for contemplative sections. For best results, {i}queue{/i} it after {i}play{/i}ing the intro file "Yumemiteta no Atashi (Story Version A) intro.flac".	game/tutorial.rpy	2226	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_0e0f2087	gio	This track, following Yumemiteta no Atashi's CHORUS, is named "Yumemiteta no Atashi (Story Version B).flac". Unlike its more moody and atmospheric partner, this track features bright, optimistic piano and an uptempo feel to inspire hope and courage.	game/tutorial.rpy	2229	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_89ca9122	gio	This song is a background music rendition of 24h by DAOKO named "24h (Story Version).flac". Its celebratory electronic fanfares couple nicely with bass slaps to create a suave, intimate and festive feeling. For best results, {i}queue{/i} it after {i}play{/i}ing the intro file "24h (Story Version) intro.flac".	game/tutorial.rpy	2235	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_71e43863	gio	This song, "Utopia.flac" is also by DAOKO. Its upbeat chimes and waltz-like meter are perfect for happy moments, especially establishing moments in a story that set up the status quo.	game/tutorial.rpy	2240	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_e2e003fa	gio	This song, Kibou no Oto, is an original made by DAOKO for Dragalia Lost. This vocalless version, "Kibou no Oto (Sound of Hope) - Off-Vocals.mp3", creates an air of mystery and urgency with its soft piano and chimes. It's perfect for moments where deep-seated truths or hidden potentials are uncovered.	game/tutorial.rpy	2245	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_61816a41	gio	This song, New Alberia, is another Daoko original for Dragalia Lost. This soundtrack ("New Alberia.flac"), evoking a dramatic decision, features heavy piano chords in a minor key, an urgent tempo and several meter changes.	game/tutorial.rpy	2249	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_16ea14dc	gio	This song, "Threatening Aura.flac", features oppressive, aggressive string notes accompanied by a shouting, dissonant choir to create... well, a 'threatening aura.' For best results, {i}queue{/i} it after {i}play{/i}ing the intro file "Threatening Aura intro.flac".	game/tutorial.rpy	2254	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_f1266d98	gio	This song, "gentle dawn temp.flac", features soft, hopeful piano, evoking a sunrise or quiet tranquility. I'm... not sure if this comes from an existing Daoko song or not, so I've named it 'gentle dawn' temporarily. For best results, {i}queue{/i} it after {i}play{/i}ing the intro file "gentle dawn temp intro.flac".	game/tutorial.rpy	2259	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_f03e4d42	gio	Now, let's get into songs by some other artists. DAOKO is but one of many artists that have contributed to the soundtrack of "Dragalia Lost".	game/tutorial.rpy	2267	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_66c4ff33	gio	This song, Kaede (meaning "maple leaf"), was a cover performed by Lucretzia for the Resplendent Refrain event. The swelling guitar chords in this file ("Kaede (Maple Leaf) - Off-Vocals loop.mp3") that slowly build up to an emotional climax are perfect for heartfelt moments.	game/tutorial.rpy	2270	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_bfb686be	gio	This song, Arikitari, is by the artist WON for the Dragalia Lost event One Starry Dragonyule. Its upbeat guitar riffs intermixed with quiet moments evoke the exhiliration of flying through the snow on a snowboard. Access it under the filename "BGM (Arikitari) WON Dragalia Lost - One Starry Dragonyule.mp3".	game/tutorial.rpy	2273	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_musicfiles_c36855d8	gio	Well, that represents all the music files currently built into this Story Engine. Hopefully you've stumbled upon something that stirs your heart and soul with the joy of music!	game/tutorial.rpy	2277	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_end_b747404f	gio	Ah, I see. Unfortunate, but I suppose we have already spent quite a while talking.	game/tutorial.rpy	2295	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_end_2404402b	gio	Ah, how the time flies, never to return!	game/tutorial.rpy	2297	gio "[what]"

tutorial_music_end_b80c9943	gio	In the meantime, I must prepare for my next great performance! {i}Arrivederci, miei adorabili amici{/i}!	game/tutorial.rpy	2301	gio "[what]"
tutorial_music_end_b4468873	nott	Whew, what a wild ride! I never thought I'd learn that much about music just from an offhand comment...	game/tutorial.rpy	2309	nott "[what]"
tutorial_music_end_efb69ae8	eud	Yeah, but everything Giovanni told us was extremely helpful! I can't wait to start playing around with music again.	game/tutorial.rpy	2314	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_end_22b67595	eud	Maybe I'll finally take up piano again! I'm suddenly inspired to start making some of my OWN music!	game/tutorial.rpy	2319	eud "[what]"
tutorial_music_end_9db22f58	eud	Well, I'm gonna go track it down. Thanks for stopping by again, friend! Hope you learned as much as I did!	game/tutorial.rpy	2323	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_764974ea	eud	Ah, sorry, DabblerDragon hasn't written this part yet! But he has a channel explaining how to do it in the Dragalia Lost Story Engine discord!	game/tutorial.rpy	2351	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_06d40554	eud	Oh, also, some miscellaneous things: DabblerDragon's figured out how to do some basic animation stuff.	game/tutorial.rpy	2353	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_5f5023ef	eud	It seems like you need to actively crop the white space out of character portraits because they currently occupy the same space as the screen.	game/tutorial.rpy	2354	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_3966b72a	eud	So even if you try to make the portrait move, it's locked in place by the pixel limits. (Ren'py doesn't like moving images over the edge of the screen, I guess?)	game/tutorial.rpy	2355	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_8337b64f	eud	Anyway, if you want to define an animation for a cropped image, you can look at some of the examples, like the ones for Finni and Eirene.	game/tutorial.rpy	2356	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_7a356fff	eud	To make an animation you have to define a 'transform.' You can define the coordinates with 'xalign' and 'yalign'.	game/tutorial.rpy	2357	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_8f71e694	eud	To make a linear movement, say 'linear' with a time duration followed by 'xalign' to the new x pos and 'yalign' to the new ypos.	game/tutorial.rpy	2358	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_542e528c	eud	You can also use statements like 'zoom' in the transform to change the size of an image!	game/tutorial.rpy	2359	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_3cc20722	eud	With color matrices, you can even change the coloration of an image! Check out the 'sepia' transform dabblerdragon defined!	game/tutorial.rpy	2360	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_76f40a62	eud	In addition to these topics, please let DabblerDragon know what topics you want this tutorial to cover! It's still very much a work in progress!	game/tutorial.rpy	2361	eud "[what]"
tutorial_implementing_characters_2b93b749	eud	For now, thanks for trying out Dragalia Lost Story Engine! We hope you'll be able to use this to let your imagination run wild and have a fresh encounter with your favorite characters.	game/tutorial.rpy	2362	eud "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_1d662b7e	zeth	Wow, this forest grotto is even more beautiful than I could have ever imagined!	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	527	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_cf8548e8	zeth	(relaxed small_smile1) I came here to check on the Lambentree, but being here in solutude surrounded by the blessings of mana is so invigorating! I've never even seen some of these plants before.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	530	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_85493340	zeth	(surprised frown1) Oh?	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	533	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_90410130	zeth	(focused mutter1) My reflection looks so out of place here... and... there's something different in my eyes...	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	536	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_f4ac16ee	zeth	(other_angry grin1) Indeed. You should know it well, my sweet Auspex. You will never be able to fully purge my influence from you.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	539	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_94b86f89	zeth	(angry shout1) ...The Other!! Oh no! Why are you emerging now from within me?	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	542	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_cd970b90	zeth	(other_pained smile1) Surely that's not a real question? I should think it obvious that the Lambentree amplifies all mana--including mine.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	545	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_f10ce1e9	zeth	(pained frown2) Of course... but I must not allow this! You cannot be permitted back into the world, even as a shadow of your former self within me.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	548	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_b68f5a15	zeth	(other_relaxed awkward1) I don't understand why you're talking about this like you have a choice in the matter. As long as hatred exists in the world, so too will I.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	551	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_a9dcff10	zeth	(grumpy pout1) That may be true, but that doesn't mean I'll continue to let you have free reign over my body! Haaaaah!	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	554	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_0db497ad	zeth	(other_angry2 pout2) Tsk. Crystallizing the ambient mana of prayer and coating your entire body with it? What an annoying little barrier you've managed to construct.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	561	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_7a68c458	zeth	(angry mutter1) That's right. Had enough yet, or do you need me to unleash the full power of an Auspex on you?	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	564	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_f84eca44	zeth	(other_relaxed mutter2) (sigh) I suppose I'd rather not deal with such an annoyance. Besides, I never intended this to be the moment of my escape anyway.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	567	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_6d4da4bb	zeth	(other_focused grin1) I just wanted to have a little chat with you, sweet little Auspex. After all, I'll always live inside you, so I have all the time in the world...	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	570	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_559771cc	zeth	(closed_focused closed_frown1) ...	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	573	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_33fe2aac	zeth	(sad frown1) ...I think I've contained him. For now.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	576	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_6f4c3dc8	zeth	(pained smile2) And here I thought I could take a break from my troubles... I suppose it really will be a long road ahead for me...	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	579	zeth "[what]"
zethia_character_procedures_8a3b056b	zeth	(closed_relaxed frown1) ...Well, staying here won't do me much good. I should leave here before the mana density here triggers another attack.	game/zethia_character_procedures.rpy	582	zeth "[what]"
zodiark_character_procedures_02171a2c	zodi	Oh, hello, scion of Aurelius. What brings you to a place of gloom such as this?	game/zodiark_character_procedures.rpy	220	zodi "[what]"
zodiark_character_procedures_41053163	zodi	(normal mouth_open1) ...I see. You have questions about your father.	game/zodiark_character_procedures.rpy	223	zodi "[what]"
zodiark_character_procedures_94d8282c	zodi	(closed mouth_closed1) The memories I have recieved from Aurelius are limited, but I will still answer to the best of my abilities.	game/zodiark_character_procedures.rpy	226	zodi "[what]"
zodiark_character_procedures_cf993810	zodi	(surprised mouth_wide1) ...You wish to know what {i}I{/i} thought of your father?	game/zodiark_character_procedures.rpy	229	zodi "[what]"
zodiark_character_procedures_db145d88	zodi	(mouth_wide_flap1) ...Well, obviously I had great respect for him, given that I chose to form a pact with him.	game/zodiark_character_procedures.rpy	232	zodi "[what]"
zodiark_character_procedures_eabc7ee3	zodi	(mouth_open_flap1) During his reign, I thought he made choices to wield power for the sake of his family and kingdom.	game/zodiark_character_procedures.rpy	235	zodi "[what]"
zodiark_character_procedures_11c8dbea	zodi	However, while I was by Aurelius's side for many years, only you were able to unlock my true potential.	game/zodiark_character_procedures.rpy	241	zodi "[what]"
zodiark_character_procedures_8f781c1a	zodi	This form is something you and you alone have witnessed over the past millenia. Aurelius and I are both so proud of you, child.	game/zodiark_character_procedures.rpy	245	zodi "[what]"
