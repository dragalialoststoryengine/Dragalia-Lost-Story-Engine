    # Summer Notte Character Procedures File

    # Paste this file into a story if you want to use Summer Notte.  These procedures animate Summer Notte as a speaker.
    # You'll also need to paste THIS line into your actual script above the script label whenever you're using Summer Notte:

define snott = Character("Notte", callback=speaker("snott"))

    # This program assumes that the following folders exist:
    #     -"images/notte_summer"
    #     -"images/notte_summer/faces"
    #     -"images/notte_summer/mouths"

    # Summer Notte dynamically blinks and, while speaking, also moves her mouth along with the text scroll.

    # FUNCTIONS:

    # *Making Summer Notte appear*:
    #  -->  show notte_summer with dissolve
    #       ("with dissolve" is optional but makes transitions cleaner)

    # *Changing Summer Notte's eyes*:
    #  -->  show notte_summer [keyword]
    #  List of eye keywords:
    #     -->  relaxed (default), closed_relaxed, relaxed2, closed_relaxed2, focused,
    #          sad, closed_sad, sad2, shock, surprised, blush, closed_blush

    # *Changing Summer Notte's mouth*:
    #  -->  show notte_summer [keyword]
    #  List of mouth keywords:
    #     -->  smile1 (default), smile2, frown1, frown2, sweat_frown1,
    #          shout1, shout2, closed_smile1

    # *Writing dialogue for Summer Notte*:
    #  --> snott "[Summer Notte's line here]"

    # *Making Summer Notte disappear*:
    #  --> hide notte_summer with dissolve
    #       ("with dissolve" is optional but makes transitions cleaner)
