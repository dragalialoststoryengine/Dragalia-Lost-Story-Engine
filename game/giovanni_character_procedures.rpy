    # Paste this file into a story if you want to use Giovanni.  These procedures animate giovanni as a speaker.
    # You'll also need to paste THIS line into your actual script above the script label whenever you're using Giovanni:

define gio = Character("Giovanni", callback=speaker("gio"))

    # This program assumes that the following folders exist:
    #     -"images/giovanni"
    #     -"images/giovanni/faces"

    # Giovanni dynamically blinks and, while speaking, also moves her mouth along with the text scroll.

    # FUNCTIONS:

    # *Making Giovanni appear*:
    #  -->  show giovanni with dissolve
    #       ("with dissolve" is optional but makes transitions cleaner)

    # *Changing Giovanni's eyes*:
    #  -->  show giovanni [keyword]
    #  List of eye keywords:
    #     -->  closed_neutral (default), angry, happy, open, sad, surprised

    # *Writing dialogue for Giovanni*:
    #  --> gio "[Giovanni's line here]"

    # *Making Giovanni disappear*:
    #  --> hide giovanni with dissolve
    #       ("with dissolve" is optional but makes transitions cleaner)
